<p class="ph2">THE HAUNTED ISLAND</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER I.<br>

<small>SCAMPERING AWAY.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> Christmas Eve, 1668, I, Francis Clayton,
was with my brother Dick at Clayton Manor, our
father’s house. ’Tis seated on the bottom of a
Bay near Wembury, on the sea coast of Devon.
My brother served in quality of lieutenant on
board His Majesty’s ship <i>Tiger</i>, and was but
late returned from a cruise off the Island of
Jamaica. His ship lay at anchor in the bay.</p>

<p>We sat over against one another on the hearth,
in my little snug room. The Squire and the
servants were a-bed. The great old house slept,
with starting and creaking of the timbers. The
fire was sunk together, burning with a clear
glow; the candles were wasted to the snuff in
their sockets.</p>

<p>My brother told a marvellous tale of the
South Sea, of an island there haunted by spirits,
particularly by a monstrous great ghoul, or
devil.</p>

<p>“Many rumours,” said he, “are gotten abroad
of this enchanted island. ’Tis said that he who
laid up the treasure had a truck with the devil,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
and that a frightful fiend hath guard over it. I
do certainly know ’tis there. As to the rest, I
am nothing concerned with such fantastic gear.
Once ashore there,” said he, “and not all the
devils in hell shall keep me from the treasure!
Yet, if seamen who have seen the Thing be not
extremely out, ’tis a pretty wight! The head of
it, say they, reaches unto the clouds, and the
appearance of it is frightful out of all description.”</p>

<p>There came a sudden tap-tapping in the
wainscoting. It was, no doubt, but a rat; but, I
must confess, I shrank with fear of it: whereupon
my brother clapped me boisterously on
the shoulder, crying:</p>

<p>“Hallo, my land-captain! Did you think it
was the ghosts from the Haunted Island? I’ll
show you something to cheer you up.”</p>

<p>Hereupon, clapping hand to pocket, he plucked
forth a little box, or casket. It was of gold,
very cunningly wrought with the representation
of a galleon; and her hull was of rubies, her
sails of pearls, her flag and flowing pendants of
emeralds and sapphires, and the sea of amethyst.</p>

<p>It was exquisite, and I said so; but my
brother bade me read what was written on a
piece of parchment that he took from the box
and laid open before me.</p>

<p>“I know you like poesy,” said he, “read it.
’Tis better than a sonnet to my lady’s shoe-latchet!”</p>

<p>The writing was old and small, and thus it
was:</p>

<div class="indent2">Go you not close abroad:</div>

</div>
<div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">As I was sailing the sea, Captain,</div>

<div class="verse">We anchored off the island, Captain;</div>
<div class="indent2">We lay off cables four:</div>

<div class="indent2">Be praise and gramercy:</div>

</div></div></div>

<p>Here the ballad was broken off. I asked
what it was; but had never answer. For, on a
sudden, a summons loud and long sounded upon
the Manor door.</p>

<p>“Hallo! What’s this?” cried I. But my
brother said nothing; only got from his chair,
and stepped to the casement; as I did also. He
drew the shutter; and we peered without upon
the avenue. ’Twas a wintry and a weird
prospect: the moon shone bleak through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
scantly falling snow, which was flurried about in
drifts of powder on the frozen ground. The
tall elms stood gauntly up, the smaller branches
of them stirring in sudden movements, like
hands and fingers. But at the great door there
was a little fat man in the uniform of the captain
of a King’s ship. He stood panting, his face
fiery red; and kept pummelling with his cane
upon the flagstones.</p>

<p>“Why, ’tis the captain of your ship!” said I.
“’Tis Captain Skinton!” But, muttering in his
teeth, Dick turned and hurried from the room.
I followed, to find him at the end of the corridor
warily withdrawing the arras. We looked
through.</p>

<p>The Captain addressed the serving-man who
had opened to him, and was beside himself with
passion. He spoke in rapid and high-pitched
tones, and with robustious gesticulation. We
caught a tail-end: “—that I see Squire Clayton
this night!”</p>

<p>“But he’s a-bed, your honour,” says Roger.</p>

<p>“Then wake him! wake him! wake him!”
cried the little man; and, stamping by misadventure
a gouty foot, he broke into a paroxysm
of rage, just as the Squire, our father, came
forth on the gallery of the stairs.</p>

<p>“What’s this? What’s this?” says he, looking
down in his nightcap.</p>

<p>“What’s this, sir?” cries Skinton, his voice
rising shrill, “what’s this, sir? Why, your son,
sir ... a conspiracy, sir, a conspiracy aboard
my ship, <i>my</i> ship, sir!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>“Roger,” says the Squire, “how came you to
admit this neighing rascal? Show him into the
stable!”</p>

<p>Hereupon the Captain became perfectly
furious; but the Squire returned him word for
word, as hot as he gave, so that there fell a very
great clamour. And, in the hurly-burly, Dick stole
past them into the hall, I following; and so (the
door having been left open), out into the night.</p>

<p>We scoured down the avenue, crossed the road
beyond, and, striking into the countryside, cut
crisply across the frozen fields to the cliff-top;
then down, helter-skelter, to the shore.</p>

<p>A great ship lay at an anchor close in, with her
sails hauled up in brails. It was the <i>Tiger</i>.
Her captain’s boat lay beached above the
breakers; and her crew walked up and down, to
keep them warm. My brother stepped to the
coxswain, “’Tis I, John,” said he, as he got his
breath; and, to the rest, he said: “Back to the
ship, men! Our plans are at a head! All’s
ready! I’ll make all your fortunes, my jolly
boys!”</p>

<p>“Ay, ay, sir! ay, ay!” But he bade them
hush, and hasten with the boat. Thereupon,
turning to me, “Get you back to the Manor!”
says he.</p>

<p>“No; I go with you,” said I.</p>

<p>He looked me up and down: “Tut, tut, d’ye
know where we’re bound? For the South Sea,
and on none of the King’s business either!”</p>

<p>“You’re going to steal the ship!” said I; but
they were shoving off the boat, and, before ever<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
he could answer, or I take thought, we found
ourselves aboard and rolling over the waves.
Soon there fell a great barking of dogs from the
direction of the Manor; whereupon my brother
did urge the rowers to greater effort. A few
moments after we reached the ship.</p>

<p>We went aboard at the gang-way. There stood
a big, black-bearded fellow, who passed on board
in the style of the Quartermaster. My brother
spoke a word in his ear, and the man nodded.</p>

<p>“All have joined, Ouvery?” asked Dick.</p>

<p>“Ay, but the master and Surgeon Burke be
aboard. They went not ashore with the rest.”</p>

<p>“’Sdeath!” said Dick with his teeth, “where
are they, then?”</p>

<p>“The master’s in his cabin: Burke’s in the
round-house.”</p>

<p>“Overboard with the master! Let him swim,
the preaching swab! But we’ll have need of
Burke. Have up the men; I’ll speak to ’em.
Haste, Ouvery!”</p>

<p>He made to the quarter-deck as he spoke,
while the other went below. Soon was heard
the boatswain’s whistle, and the mariners began
to come up on deck. Meantime there came a
splashing under the stern, and the master swam
presently forth within sight. Having gotten his
breath, he began to shout threats and imprecations
at my brother. But Dick laughed, and shook his
finger at him, crying:</p>

<p>“Nay, nay, sweet sir, be not so prodigal with
your strength! I warrant you’ll need all of it
anon!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>On this, with a last imprecation, the swimmer
turned, and incontinently made towards the shore.
But the mariners were now gotten all up on
deck, and my brother prepared to speak to them.</p>

<p>But no speech was made by him. For a
musket-shot rang out on the shore, and some
half-dozen men, led by the Captain and the
Squire, came forth on the cliff—the Captain
shouting and gesticulating with the smoking
musket that he held; but our father stood like a
man sore stricken, so that it went to my heart to
see him. I turned to my brother:</p>

<p>“Go you no further with this,” said I. “Return
while yet you may.”</p>

<p>But he did not answer me; he stood staring
to windward, and I saw his face set hard. A big
ship, flying the flag of St. George, had hove in
sight round a bend of the cliff.</p>

<p>Next moment he turned; and, bawling out,
“In with the boat!” cried he, “All hands make
sail! Up anchor and away!”</p>

<p>There fell a great ado on this, as the mariners
went to work to the shrill piping whistle of the
boatswain, and the word of command. Soon the
cable was hove in, while the seamen sang as they
strained at the capstan. Soon the ship began to
move, stretching away under her spritsail and
topsails to the shore-breeze.</p>

<p>But the other vessel had hoisted up her topgallant
sails, and came on apace; and now, being
but a cable’s length away, she shot off a gun.</p>

<p>“Come on, ye dogs!” cried Dick. “Fire away,
and split!” And he hasted to the poop, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
the gunners worked, charging of the stern-chasers.</p>

<p>“Double shot ’em, and cripple her!” said he.</p>

<p>“Ay, ay, sir! ay, ay!” But now the pursuer
fired again, and a round-shot crashed into our
round-house coach.</p>

<p>“<i>Fire!</i>” and, upon the word, the guns belched
forth flame. The report shook the ship, and a
cloud of cannon-smoke rolled up like a scroll.</p>

<p>As it cleared, our men roared out with a great
cheering; for we had hit the King’s ship full in
her fore rigging, split her spritsail, smashed her
foreyard, and handsomely mauled the shrouds.
The foremast shook with the brunt, and the topsail
came clattering down.</p>

<p>Hereupon my brother fell to capering about
like a silly schoolboy.</p>

<p>“Well done, master-gunner!” cried he, “well
done, my brave! Give him another cheer, my
jolly boys! They’ll not take us, this bout!”</p>

<small>FRANCIS DREAMS A DREAM.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> now rapidly left the floundering and mazed
man-of-war. But our men kept firing into the
medley on her decks, plying the stern-chasers in
furious haste; and, ever as he was able, the
enemy did shoot at us with muskets and pistols,
and once—his ship having slewed right round—gave
us a thundering great broadside. But his
gunners did much mistake, in that they hulled
us (as the saying is), instead of aiming at our
masts and tackling, whereby they might have
crippled us, and, perhaps, brought us quite to a
stand.</p>

<p>As it was, our ship took no great hurt, though
the splinters flew, and six of her ports were
battered in; yet many of our men were wounded
after a dreadful manner, and one was killed outright.
Whereupon such brutish and demoniac
fury came upon the rest as transported them like
very devils.</p>

<p>Our decks were bloody like a slaughter-house;
and from the spar-deck the wounded men roared
out very grievously as Surgeon Burke wrought
upon them, so that their groans and shrieks did
mingle with the horrid blasphemies.</p>

<p>Now, all this time my brother, the Captain,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
did frantically rage as hot as any man; yea, so
far beside himself was he, that, when he found
we drew out of gunshot and could no longer
murder the King’s men, he was for going about
and returning upon them. He had even given
the order to bear up the helm; but hereupon, to
my huge surprise, the Quartermaster did interpose.
’Twas no more than a look and a word,
but it availed, and the order was immediately
revoked.</p>

<p>We now lay right out of the bay; and, having
set studding sails, stood off to sea, whilst the
decks were cleared, the broken ports stopped,
and the bolts and tackling overhauled. But I,
being sick at heart, went and shut myself in the
master’s cabin, which I found empty; and, a great
weariness coming over me, I got me into a
hammock, and presently slept.</p>

<p>I dreamed a fearful dream; and it seemed to
me that one went before me through a gully in
a terrible high cliff. And the gully became dark
and darker as we went, and its sheer sides of
dank rock towered higher yet; so that they were
frightful to look on. Still they rose and rose,
until their tops might no longer be discerned;
and darkness fell, a darkness that seemed to
wither my soul! Then he who went before me
did turn himself about, and lo! ’twas Ouvery, the
Quartermaster. His face gleamed ghastly white,
but his eyes were blacker than the darkness.
They seized on mine, and held them—for ever!</p>

<p>I woke gasping and shaking; and there were
two eyes as black as jet fixed on mine! Ouvery,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
the Quartermaster, gazed across at me from the
middle of the cabin, where he sat in close
converse with my brother.</p>

<p>He got up from his chair; and, making a sign
that I was awake, immediately went out. Hereupon
my brother rose also, and stepped to my
hammock.</p>

<p>“Well, my heart,” said he, “hast been a-voyaging
to Tophet, or is’t the ghosts from the
Haunted Island? Bless us! you screeched like
a stuck pig.”</p>

<p>“Scoff away! Scoff away!” cried I. “’Twill be
another tale to-morrow!”</p>

<p>“Ay!” said he, but I thought his countenance
fallen, “pieces-of-eight, and golden bars, and
jewels—jewels by the shipload—that’ll be the tale
to-morrow!”</p>

<p>“And a hempen cord about your neck, and
iron chains to hang in, and yokel faces a-gape at
you!”</p>

<p>On that he flamed out in a fury, snapping his
fingers, swearing and cursing. But I let him
rave, answering nothing, and soon he fell quiet,
and throwing himself into a chair, sat still,
seeming to brood in his mind.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III.<br>

<small>THE CASTAWAYS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">After</span> these events, there fell out nothing worth
remark in many days.</p>

<p>We had favourable winds and calm seas, and
met with no King’s ships. What other craft we
met withal, meddled not with us, nor we with
them. Through great part of the Bay of Biscay
we steered our course close under the coast of
France, until we came to an anchor in a small
bay thereby, to take in water and fresh provisions;
thence we sailed away, standing to the
open sea. We passed the Cape of Finisterre;
and so onwards towards the Tropic of Cancer
and the Line.</p>

<p>I come to a day in the fifth week of our
voyage. I got up betimes, and went on deck.
The ship went merrily along. There was not a
sail in sight, nor any glimpse of land; but from
horizon to horizon spread the dancing, shining
sea, and I thought it was a gracious scene, like
a world from the hands of God.</p>

<p>As I looked, I spied a dark blur of a thing
far out upon the waters. It disappeared, but
soon hove in sight again, this time quite clear.
In the same moment, the look-out man bawled:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>“Boat adrift on the larboard bow.”</p>

<p>“Lay to, then, and man the jolly-boat,” cried
the Captain.</p>

<p>The mariners went eagerly to work, snapping
greedily at the exciting chance. The jolly-boat,
which was towing astern, was speedily hauled in
and manned; but the coxswain was shoved from
his wonted command of her by Ouvery, who put
himself into the stern-sheets. I, being full of
curiosity, jumped into the boat as they made
ready to pull away; whereupon Ouvery did
look upon me balefully, though he spoke no
word, and I knew that he hated me from the
bottom of his black heart!</p>

<p>“Pull away,” said the Quartermaster; and she
began to move apace. I, keeping my eyes fixed
upon the boat we steered for, at length descried
a huddled heap on board of her, which was
presently discovered to be the forms of two
men. We drew alongside, and lay board on
board together, gazing upon a dismal, dreadful
sight.</p>

<p>For there in the boat were two gaunt and
wasted forms—yea, the very death’s heads did
grin in the dwindled faces of those poor
castaways.</p>

<p>One was an Indian: a tall, well-knit figure
dark copper-coloured; his face long and hard-favoured;
lank black hair.</p>

<p>The other was an European, and, as it should
seem, an Englishman. His yellow beard fell
long and untrimmed, and his clothes were mean
and old; yet there was that in his look made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
me think he was a gentleman. What, however,
was remarkable: on sight of the castaways,
Ouvery gave a great start and drew sharply in
his breath.</p>

<p>“They be dead men both,” said a man,
solemnly; “rest to their souls!”</p>

<p>But I had got into the boat; and, taking a
mirror that I had about me, I held it in turn to
those parted and writhen lips, and lo! it twice
became clouded with breath.</p>

<p>“They live! they live!” cried I. But Ouvery
said quickly:</p>

<p>“Nay, nay! You know nothing at all.
Down, ye meddler, and out of the way!” And
to the mariners he said:</p>

<p>“Overboard with them! We’ll have no truck
with the dead! And keep your tongue quiet,”
said he, glaring at me, “or you shall sweep with
them!”</p>

<p>“I say that they live!” I returned passionately.
“Carry them to the ship!”</p>

<p>On that, Ouvery raised his clenched fist to
strike me down. “You barking cur,” cried he,
“do you meddle with my orders? I’ll have
you clapt in irons! I’ll flay you to the bone!
I’ll——”</p>

<p>“Belike you’re captain of the ship,” said I,
flouting him; “I thought my brother was
captain.”</p>

<p>Ouvery sat still, all swollen with rage; but
hereupon up spoke a seaman, saying stoutly:</p>

<p>“Maybe the boy’s in the right. Ho! make
way here!” He climbed over into the cock-boat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
as he spoke, and soon had confirmed my
words.</p>

<p>But Ouvery rose up like one possessed; and,
drawing his knife, he reached forth to have
stabbed me. But the boat began to rock nigh
foundering; and, losing his footing, he fell,
knocking his head against an oar that was outboard,
and slid over into the sea. They fished
him out ere he sank, and flung him like a log
in the bottom of the boat, where he lay stunned.</p>

<p>Hereupon, having made the cock-boat fast to
our stern, we returned to the ship. My brother
stood at the gang-way, awaiting us; I acquainted
him with what had befallen, demanding that
Ouvery should be restrained. But he regarded
me not at all.</p>

<p>They contrived a bed for the Indian in the
forecastle, but the other was installed in the
master’s cabin beneath the poop, where I slept,
some bedding being laid for me on the floor.
Tended by Surgeon Burke, and cared for by the
mariners, the Indian made a quick recovery;
but the other lay as one dead, being fallen into
a sort of coma or trance.</p>

<p>The Indian came out of his swoon about
sundown. Dick, Burke, and I stood beside his
bed, when the poor man, on a sudden, stirred
and opened his eyes. He looked from one to
another of us wildly; and moved his lips as
if he would speak. At this juncture, heavy and
uncertain footfalls were heard without, and
Ouvery came lumbering in, his face mottled red
and purple. He approached; but, on sight of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
him, the Indian stared aghast, stretched forth an
arm with a fierce, frenzied gesture, uttered a cry,
and sank back beside his senses.</p>

<p>“Why, he knoweth him!” cried I. “He hath
seen you before, Ouvery! If he could speak, I
warrant you’d stand proclaimed a black villain!”</p>

<p>I was out of myself with passion, and I knew
not what I said. But the Quartermaster was
transported with fury, and, rasping out horrid
oaths, he drew a pistol from his belt and let fly
at me. The ball missed my head by a hair’s
breadth, and was buried in the wooden wall.
Ouvery made a dash towards me, reeled, and
lurched forward upon the floor. There he lay
stunned, having knocked his head against the
table-leg.</p>

<p>The episode had passed in a moment, and
Dick and the surgeon stood like men dumbfounded.
Burke recovered himself:</p>

<p>“You’ve had a narrow squeak, my lad,” said
he. “The man’s a maniac—look you, Captain!”</p>

<p>But Dick dashed his fist against the wall
for mad.</p>

<small>VILLAINY.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I went</span> on deck, to behold a night of calm and
beauty. There was no moon; but the hosts of
the stars burned in a clear element, upon a
solemn ground, and I thought they were like
gems in the mantle of God.</p>

<p>But, as I stood, leaning on the bulwarks,
dreaming in the blue starlight, on a sudden a
hand was laid on my shoulder, and a hearty
voice cried:</p>

<p>“Wake up, young star-gazer! What are you
dreaming of now? Wouldst know:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">What worlds or what vast regions hold</div>
<div class="verse">The immortal mind that hath forsook</div>
<div class="verse">Her mansion in this fleshy nook?”</div>
</div></div>

<p>“What, old physicker!” (for ’twas Surgeon
Burke), “‘Throw physic to the dogs, I’ll none
of it!’”</p>

<p>He laughed boisterously at the return; then
bade me follow him below, saying that the
English castaway was coming out of his swoon.
We went quickly to the master’s cabin, where
the Englishman lay stretched upon a day-bed
or settee. But, instead of the stark and deadly
look he had before, his breast heaved to a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>
gentle respiration, his eyes were closed, and
there was even a trace of colour in his hollow
cheeks.</p>

<p>“When he wakes,” said Burke, “he’ll be
recovered, and that will be no great while either.”</p>

<p>But in this point he was out; for the exhausted
man continued in his babe-like sleep. At last,
being perfectly tired out, I cast myself down
upon the bedding on the floor, and took up my
repose. Yet I could not presently sleep; for
my thoughts were tumultuous and uneasy to
the last degree, running continually upon those
strange happenings—more especially upon the
desire manifested by Ouvery to make away with
the castaways and strange recognition of him
by the Mosquito Indian. However, at last I slept.</p>

<p>It must have been upon the stroke of
midnight that I woke up suddenly from an
unquiet sleep, to hear the sound of stealthy
footsteps in the gang-way without.</p>

<p>I listened, my heart beginning to thump upon
my sides, my eyes upon the door. The handle
turned slowly; the door was softly opened.
Then, half-closing my eyes, I feigned slumber,
as, vivid in moonshine cast through the port, the
face of Ouvery appeared in the chink.</p>

<p>The Quartermaster stood peering and listening.
He entered, and advanced on me; and there
was a knife in his hand. Yet I continued
to feign slumber, and, though near dead with
terror, to make my breathing appear regular
and slow.</p>

<p>At last he was at my side. I opened my eyes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
then, ready to evade a deadly thrust, and lo!
the man was passed by me and moving towards
the Englishman on the bed. On that my nerve
came back to me; the spell was broken.</p>

<p>I made one leap of it half across the cabin
floor; and, as the Quartermaster, his face set in
savage lines, his arm drawn back to thrust, bent
over the slumbering Englishman, quick as light
I snatched the pistol from his belt and set it
close and firm to his ear.</p>

<p>“Drop your blade,” said I, “or I’ll fire.”</p>

<p>Ouvery was no craven, but, on touch of the
iron muzzle, he started and dropped his knife.
He held perfectly still, muttering something that
I had no care to hear; and I bawled loud and
repeatedly, “Help! Help!”</p>

<p>It was then that the Englishman came out of
his swoon; and, rising up in his bed, “Where
am I?” cried he. “What is this?”</p>

<p>“You are on the ship <i>Tiger</i>,” replied I. “You
were taken up from a driving boat—you with
an Indian, who also is on the ship.”</p>

<p>“Ha! And this fellow?”</p>

<p>“He is the Quartermaster. He was about to
murder you; I know not why.”</p>

<p>“O-ho!” cried he, “a mystery! I am even
eager to fathom it. Turn hither, fellow, that I
may look upon the majesty of your countenance.
Turn hither, I say!”</p>

<p>But Ouvery, on a sudden, ducked his head;
and, with incredible swiftness, whipped from
the cabin, and was gone. Yet the other had got
view of his face, and he cried:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>“The pirate! ’Tis the pirate, by the Lord
Harry!</p>

<p>“So I am fallen among thieves and murderers!”
says he, turning to me with fine disdain. “Well,
’tis not the first time. You’re out on the
account—heh?”</p>

<p>I was taken aback at this, and knew not what
to answer. Yet something in his countenance
told me he was a man I might trust. I resolved
to tell him distinctly how it was with us; and,
as briefly as possible, I did so.</p>

<p>He heard me out in silence, his keen eyes
searching me.</p>

<p>“Why, here is a lad of mettle,” says he, “and—what
should ever accompany this quality—of
integrity. I thank you for your confidence
reposed in me; it shall not miscarry. And
now” (as I stood abashed by his courtly phrase)
“and now for action!”</p>

<p>But, with the word, there came the tramp of
men approaching, and the boatswain entered,
having a lantern in one hand and a bare cutlash in
the other; and close at his heels came my brother.</p>

<p>The boatswain stood still at the entry; but
Dick thrust by him, and came forth into the
cabin, asking what the matter was.</p>

<p>I left it to the Englishman to answer, and he
did so.</p>

<p>“Look you, sir,” said he, rising on an elbow
and speaking with hauteur, “I am, I suppose,
beholden to you for my life. But to save a man
from the sea, that he may be barbarously
murdered in his bed—where is the obligation?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>“What means he?” asked Dick, turning to me.</p>

<p>I told him what had passed.</p>

<p>“Ouvery! Always Ouvery!” cried he.
“What means the fellow? I begin to sicken of it!
Curses on it!”</p>

<p>And, snapping his fingers in a passion, he
rushed from the cabin.</p>

<p>The boatswain followed him out, muttering in
his beard.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V.<br>

<small>THE ENGLISHMAN’S RELATION</small><br>

<small>(THE ISLAND).</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Close</span> and bolt the door,” said the Englishman
so soon as we were alone. “That Quartermaster,
saintly soul, may be hereabout. So.
And now, my lad, get you into your hammock
again, and to sleep.”</p>

<p>But sleep was gone from me, and, when I had
told him so, he proffered to relate his experiences
to me, to pass the vigil. “And certainly,” added
he, “they are sufficiently strange.”</p>

<p>You may be sure I was nothing loth; and,
when I had put on some clothes, and brought
a chair to his bedside and seated myself, he
thus began:</p>

<p>“’Twas some two years ago, lad, that I had
occasion to ship as passenger on a ship bound
for Fort St. George.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> We left the Downs with
fair wind and weather, which continued with us
till we were come into the Indian Ocean. But
then arose a huge hurricane of wind, which blew
us from our course. It held six days, and left us
somewhere near the Island of Sumatra. Yet the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
ship remained whole; and we steered north to
recover our course, with but a fret of wind. We
scarce had got into a sailing posture, but we saw
a ship, which came towards us. And, wanting
something—I forget what it was—we made a
wiff to her. But we got more than we wanted!
For, clapping on a wind, and coming on, they
began to fire at us as hot as they could, and
brought our mainmast by the board.</p>

<p>“Well, they boarded us—as villainous a crew
as ever sailed the sea; and, though we made a
good fight, ’twas all one: our ship was taken.
We expected to be all murdered, or at least
set ashore to starve on some desolate island.”
(<i>Here I saw the door handle turn slowly and
softly round, but forbore to tell the Englishman,
lest he should break off in his relation.</i>) “Yet we
were reserved alive, to what strange, surprising
experiences I’ll tell you.</p>

<p>“They set many of us down upon the ballast,
of whom I was one. Penned together like cattle
in that darksome and stinking place, we scarce
could stir hand or foot, scarce draw breath. We
knew not the day from the night. Our victuals,
thrown to us as to dogs, scarce were fit for dogs.
The place was full of vermin; and there were
great rats. Their eyes gleamed in the darkness
like points of fire; and, ever and again, as at a
signal, the creatures came swarming down upon us.</p>

<p>“How long this lasted I know not. Certainly
many days. All fell sick, some raved with the
calenture, three died. But on a blessed morn,
at daybreak, they dragged us up out of the pit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
to the deck. Imagine what it meant to us!
You cannot—as you cannot possibly imagine
that dreadful prison. And no man apprizes at
their worth light and air and health and freedom,
look you, until he lose them.</p>

<p>“Indeed the suddenness of the change was
more than we could bear—so that three of
our company fell down in a swoon. ’Twas
strange to see, I doubt not—ay, and pitiful!
But no breath of pity moved the villainous
hearts. They threw all the swooning men into
the sea.</p>

<p>“I looked around. The pirate was come to
port. On one side of her lay our ship, on the
other, land.</p>

<p>“This land was really an island, though we
lay too close to perceive it. We beheld very
high cliffs towering to a prodigious height above
us, streaked with shining green, creeping plants,
and wreathed with vines. As I looked on them,
a sort of horror seized on me, a phantom foreboding....”</p>

<p>He paused, and lay back in his bed with
closed eyes; but soon continued, saying:</p>

<p>“Now the pinnace of the pirate lay alongside,
and the residue of our party was bidden to get
into her. Nay, we were driven into the boat!
For they did press upon us, punching and
thrusting us in the back. As villainous a crew
as ever man set eyes on! Hideous visages,
blackened with sin, scarred, mutilated with old
wounds. And they were dressed and tricked
out, these pirates, as from the wardrobe of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
world; as though it had been opened unto them,
and they had taken, every man, whatsoever he
listed. For one had a pair of taffety breeches, a
lady’s cape, and the turban of an Arab; another
the staid habit of a dignitary of Holy Church
cloaked about with the robes of a Chinaman; a
leering negro strutted in the finery of a courtier
of the king.</p>

<p>“Well, a number of ’em came down into the
boat with us, and a big man took command. He
is your Quartermaster!”</p>

<p>“Ouvery!” exclaimed I. “Was he the captain
of the pirate?”</p>

<p>“No,” said he, “he was the quartermaster,
having the second place on the ship. Well,
Ouvery—or ‘Blazing Sue,’ as they called him—having
seated himself in the stern, ordered us
to take the oars and pull to the shore. On one
of us pleading weakness, he burst forth into foul
oaths, adding:</p>

<p>“‘You shall row, though you split!’</p>

<p>“Then, rising in a frenzy, he snatched up a
musket by the barrel, felled the poor man, and,
seizing hold on the collar of his coat, slung him
over into the sea; and a huge shark immediately
swam up and griped him.</p>

<p>“For a space Ouvery sat growling and snapping
with his teeth like a dog, whilst the other
pirates jested among themselves; then he gave
the order, ‘Pull away.’</p>

<p>“We laboured at the rowing as best we might,
the rogues lolling at their ease. Only, when the
pinnace was got three parts in, they double-banked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
the oars to speed her through the shore-breakers.</p>

<p>“Having landed, our party was ordered in
single file, and so marched up the beach. Some
six or seven pirates went on either side, bearing
pistols; while Ouvery took the lead.</p>

<p>“We crossed the beach of white sand. It cast
a blinding glare (the sun now being high); so
that we were glad to come presently into a belt
of cocoa trees, the porch of a dense wood. We
passed within this wood, following a secret path.</p>

<p>“We had penetrated, it might be, a quarter of
a mile, when there was made to us an intimation.
In our path, and shining beneath a rift in the
overgrowth, we spied something round and
white, like a great chalk stone. We came up to
it. ’Twas a human skull. It grimaced in the
sun with its glistering laughter.</p>

<p>“But Ouvery, turning about, laughed aloud,
‘Ho! ho! my boys!’ cried he, ‘See how he
grins! So shall ye grin anon!’</p>

<p>“He stepped to the death’s head; and, bowing
with vilest mockery, ‘What cheer, comrade?’
said he, ‘and have they forgotten ye? Come,
hist along to Heaven!’</p>

<p>“And, drawing back his great foot, he sent
the death crashing into the overgrowth.</p>

<p>“We went a little farther, and came, as it should
seem, to an impenetrable dense thicket that was
faced with flowering creepers. Ouvery hereupon
called a halt; and, stepping to the thicket, he
thrust his hand within, and felt about amongst
the stems and leaves. Next moment, that which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
we had taken to be a thicket shook and was
broken, and a slab of iron swung forward on
hinges, leaving in the midst an orifice as black
as night.</p>

<p>“Amazed at the sight, and fearing we knew
not what, we continued to gaze.</p>

<p>“My lad, as we thus stood, there befell a thing
that lifted the hair on my scalp!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI.<br>

<small>THE ENGLISHMAN’S RELATION CONTINUED</small><br>

<small>(THE CELL).</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“’<span class="smcap">Twas</span> a sound, a voice—but whether of man, or
beast, or worse, we knew not; and it proceeded
from the chasm; a sudden, loud, weird, shrieking
sound that rose and scattered until the very
wood seemed full of it, and died gradually
away.</p>

<p>“Suddenly there leaped forth a figure. From
the darkness of the cavity it came, and stood
confronting us. ’Twas the figure of a little lad!</p>

<p>“But he was gaunt as a skeleton; and the
great seaman’s watch-coat that he wore, hung
about him like a sack, falling almost to the
ground. His legs, appearing like sticks beneath
the loosely fastened coat, were bare; and so,
also, were his feet. But strangest of all in the
look of the lad, was his face.</p>

<p>“’Twere impossible to describe it. Blithe, it
was miserable; majestic, it was menial; wise, it
was wild and witless as the face of an antic;
haggard and deadly pale, the eyes roving
continually, shining with a spectral light. The
face of a little child. And yet, I tell you, it gave
me a scare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>“The little lad stood looking upon us; then,
lifting his hand with a strange eerie gesture, he
cried:</p>

<p>“‘Welcome, ye pilgrims! Lo! lo! the
Promised Land! Milk and honey! a land
flowing with milk and honey! Eat of it! drink!
sing!—sing for joy of it! The sun! the sun!
see, ’tis red, red as the Red Sea! Aha,
Pharaoh! Where is Pharaoh now? He strives
to follow thee, O sun! Down! down! there’s
sea enough.’</p>

<p>“So he raved in his frenzy, the crazy lad; but
Ouvery, lumbering forward with a curse, took
him with his clenched fist a great buffet on the
head, so that he fell down like one dead. And
Ouvery laughed, laughed! But not for long!</p>

<p>“A man burst forth from the thicket behind,
and felled the great pirate as if he were a figure
of pasteboard!</p>

<p>“’Twas an Indian—that same Mosquito Indian
you took up with me from the boat. He
consorted with the pirates; an innocent abetter
of their devilish work, a malefactor in whom was
no guile. For the Mosquito Indians do love and
revere the English wheresoever they meet with
them, honest mariners or pirates, making no
discrimination; and are, for their part, much
esteemed by them for their valour, their
sagacity, their dexterity in striking fish, and
the like.</p>

<p>“So they look upon our countrymen as lords
and masters, and do their bidding with the
simple faith of children.... Brave, honest, kindly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
souls! who knows not what eminent service
they have done us in our conflict with that
Spanish tyrant?<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>

<p>“This Mosquito Indian loved the lad, whom
he took for dead; and, crying aloud with a bitter
cry, he cast himself upon the ground at his side,
fawning upon him as a dog fawns upon the body
of its master. But, on a sudden, he gave
another cry. He perceived that the lad lived;
and, getting swiftly to his feet, he caught him
up, and sped off with him into the wood.</p>

<p>“Ouvery lay as one dead. They plied him
with rum, forcing his teeth asunder to get
the liquor down; they bathed his hands and
brow with water fetched from a crystal spring.
But ’twas all one: he gave no sign.</p>

<p>“‘Blazing Sue’s gone!’ said a pirate.</p>

<p>“But he did mistake. For, filling his mouth
with water from the spring, another of the pirates
began to blow it in a fine spray in Ouvery’s eyes
and ears (’Tis a thing that revives even dying
men); and he began to recover his senses, and
presently staggered to his feet. When he
recalled what had befallen him, his rage was
great. Yet he kept it under; only he cast a
baleful look upon us, as he pointed to the
opening in the thicket and cried:</p>

<p>“‘Forward into the Promised Land!’</p>

<p>“You may be sure, my lad, that no man was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
very eager to obey the command. The chasm
had a fearsome look. Whither did it lead?</p>

<p>“The terror of the unknown lay heavy on us.
Yet in our reluctance and fear was an itch
of curiosity; and, though an opportunity of
escape and freedom had proffered then, I, at
least, would not have taken it! Moreover the
pistols of the guards constrained us; so we
entered the chasm and advanced in the darkness.</p>

<p>“We went on through a passage, as it should
seem, hewed out of rock. Soon the darkness
became less; and soon, in a strange, livid, ghost
light, we could descry the walls and roof. The
passage was excavated in the rock.</p>

<p>“Now the strange illumination became
exceeding bright; a cold, sepulchral, white light,
such as I had never known before. Nor was
there any lamp, or flame of fire, to acquaint us
whence it came.</p>

<p>“There was no door visible, yet there was a
door—indeed, many doors—very cunningly
concealed in the wall; and now it opened with
a clang of iron. Ouvery immediately commanded
us to stand; and, bidding me, who was
among the foremost, to follow him, he betook
himself within. Obeying, I found myself in the
strangest place I had ever known.” (<i>Here there
came a sound of tramping overhead, as if the men
had been called to quarters. The Englishman
took due notice, but did not break off in his
relation.</i>)</p>

<p>“It was a little cell, like the passage, hewed
out of the rock, and about the size of a ship’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
round-house. There was no furniture in it, save
a table and a chair. Upon the table was a
medley of things: scrolls of parchment scrawled
over with hieroglyphics, triangles, and the like;
books, pamphlets, maps, draughts, compasses,
and I know not what besides. Beneath the
table, in nooks and recesses contrived in the
walls, were all manner of jars and phials,
holding divers materials, both liquid and solid.
Also globes, retorts, crucibles, alembics, mortars.
At the farther end, beneath a brass clock, stood
a large furnace.</p>

<p>“’Twas the chamber of a scholar, the cell of
an alchemist; and in a great armchair at the
table sat the man himself.</p>

<p>“He was a very ancient man, long and large
of frame, but bowed and lean. He was dressed
in a scarlet robe like a cardinal’s. His face,
which was shaven bare, was fierce and forbidding,
and heavy and ill-shapen in the lower
parts; but his forehead was high and deep,
and his hair fell in long venerable locks,
white like snow. His eyes were large, but
deep-sunk and dull. Yet, as I was soon to
see, they could kindle in anger terribly, or
become sharp and piercing like points of steel.
And in the whole port and aspect of the man
there was power; while thought brooded
continually in the majestic wrinkles of his
brow.</p>

<p>“He spoke at once, turning to Ouvery and
clutching the sleeve of the man’s coat; and his
voice was small and shrill like a woman’s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>“‘So,’ said he, ‘they are come, the pilgrim
band, the little pilgrim band. You have
brought them to labour with us in the vineyard—is’t
not so, comrade? Thereafter they will
join. ’Tis well. ’Tis very well. And my
acid? You have brought my acid?’</p>

<p>“But at the words, I saw Ouvery start and turn
deadly pale; and in a quavering voice he said:</p>

<p>“‘Doctor, forgive! I have forgot!’</p>

<p>“The hand that toyed with Ouvery’s sleeve
closed on it like a vice; a spasm shook the
ancient man, and left him rigid; the veins
stood upon his forehead gathered in knots; his
eyes started in their sockets.</p>

<p>“For many moments he looked on the man
balefully, like a serpent. Then, uttering a
frightful cry, he snatched up a globe of glass
and cast it full at Ouvery’s head!</p>

<p>“It took him upon the forehead; and well
was it for him that the glass was but thin,
breaking to small pieces. Even so, you could
see that the man was sorely hurt. But he gave
no sign of pain, and I thought that the anger of
the Doctor was more fearful to him than any
pain, or rather, that it kept him from feeling
pain at all. Only he kept repeating:</p>

<p>“‘<i>Doctor, forgive! Doctor, forgive!</i>’</p>

<p>“‘Forgive you, you dog!’ cried the ancient
man. ‘Where is my acid? The jars are empty!
Empty! empty! empty! empty!’ He sank
back in his chair, gasping, great beads upon his
brow; and Ouvery would have seized the
occasion to flee. He leapt to the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>“But no farther! for the Doctor looked on him.
‘What!’ cried he, his rasping voice coming in
gasps, ‘would you ... would you give me the
slip?’ And then, in a horrid coaxing tone, he
added:</p>

<p>“‘Would you leave me, my child, whom I
have loved? Would you leave me, after so long
a severance? Yet who am I that I should
hinder ye, or deny your smallest desire? Get
you gone, child of my heart, get you gone—into
the <i>morass</i>!’</p>

<p>“‘Mercy!’ cried Ouvery; ‘not there! Nay,
not there!’</p>

<p>“The Doctor pointed to the door.</p>

<p>“Ouvery sank down upon the floor huddled
in fear; and, villain though he was, I could not
but have compassion for him then. But the
Doctor only laughed, and he touched a little
knob of brass that stood on the wall to his hand.</p>

<p>“Presently a young man, having a look of
suffering upon his delicately shapen, shaven
countenance, and habited in black in the manner
of a secretary, came swiftly and softly into the
cell, and stood before the Doctor, bowing almost
to the ground.</p>

<p>“‘Ambrose, summon Sebastian, and ...’</p>

<p>“He broke off, seemed to consider; and,
turning to Ouvery, he asked:</p>

<p>“‘And if I bore with you yet again?’</p>

<p>“‘Try me, Doctor! Put me to the proof;
Only do not ...’</p>

<p>“‘Peace, fool! Ambrose, begone!’ (the
young man instantly withdrew) ‘Ouvery, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
the morrow you shall sail for England—but of
that anon. Get you gone, and bring our new-come
comrades to the slave Davies, charging
him to see to it, that not a jot of care or tendance
be omitted unto them. And tell him, moreover,
that if the South Bulwark be not finished by the
third day following, he shall pass through that
door which I with all my knowledge and wit
never have been able to unlock!’</p>

<p>“But Ouvery stood gazing on him after a
vacant manner; and, rising from his chair in
fury, the Doctor cried:</p>

<p>“‘Clod of earth, lacking understanding!—ah!
take your cow’s eyes from me! Ambrose!’</p>

<p>“He touched the knob again, and, when the
young man returned, ‘Expound to this clodpole,’
said the Doctor, ‘my saying, <i>the door that hath no
key</i>!’</p>

<p>“Thereupon Ambrose turned to Ouvery;
and, like one reciting a task, he said:</p>

<p>“‘No man is able to open it, but the dead
pass through there. ’Tis the door of fate.’</p>

<p>“‘Good words, Ambrose,’ said the Doctor.
‘No man, indeed, is able to open that door. I
myself have essayed, even to weariness, but I
found no key.</p>

<p>“‘The secrets of the earth lie open to me;
but the invisible——Ha! I saw a goodly
vine; I ate of the fruit of it—knowledge,
domination, gold—and it hath turned to ashes
in my mouth! My heart was empty, and I
sought to satisfy it—with hate; and the void is
but increased!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>“‘What, then, is hate? Is’t a mere nullity?
the walling-in of the soul?</p>

<p>“‘Behold, now, this cell, a place walled off;
I banish the light of it. So.’ (He touched a
knob upon the wall, and instantly there was thick
darkness.)</p>

<p>“‘Without is light—light of the sun; but not a
ray thereof can enter here. No; but, if it be dark
without, and I throw up walls, and roof them
about, and stop up every nook and cranny, can I
keep out the darkness, as now I do the light?
No; for darkness is nothing. It cannot be shut
out: only I make it to vanish with light. So.’
(And, on a sudden, the cell was flooded with
bright light.)</p>

<p>“‘And as with light and darkness, is’t not
so, also, with good and evil, love and hate?
Ha! I see it! I see it! I know thy efficacy,
Almighty Good! thou only real power, substance,
and principle, <i>Spirit</i>, the One Spirit! With
my intellect, in which the truth is dawning, I
see it.... But thou comest not into this
heart——’”</p>

<p>At this juncture, the Englishman’s relation
was interrupted; a great gun was shot off on the
poop overhead; and, while the ship yet shook
with the reverberation, there came a great shout
of cheering thrice repeated.</p>

<p>I sprang to my feet, and, on a nod from the
Englishman, went from the cabin to find out
what this might mean.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII.<br>

<small>A HORRIBLE VILLAIN.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I stayed</span> not long in doubt. The steel-grey
light of dawn shone upon the sea; and there,
within half a mile astern of us, was a great ship
flying the flag of St. George.</p>

<p>She was out after us; a consort belike of the
vessel we had crippled in our scampering away.
A very swift sailer she must have been, considering
the speedy sailing we had made all
along. But there was small gratulation on that
score for the King’s ship now. For her foremast
had gone by the board, shot away by our stern-chasers;
and, having slewed right round, she lay
wallowing in the troughs of the sea.</p>

<p>I climbed the poop-ladder, and stepped to the
place where my brother stood with the gunners
patting caressingly the nozzle of the piece that
had served his turn so bravely. Wallis, the
master-gunner, stood looking earnestly to leeward,
where a wall of mist held down upon the
sea. He spoke a word to my brother and
pointed that way. Dick had a spyglass in his
hand, and immediately he set it to his eye,
bringing it to bear. As I drew near, I heard
him say he descried seven great ships which
stood close-hauled towards us. Hereupon he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
gave the glass to the master-gunner; who, having
looked awhile, said he took those ships for
pirates. “And you’ll leave ’em the King’s ship
to grind their teeth on, Captain,” said he,
laughing.</p>

<p>But Dick shook his head, “No, no,” said he,
“that sort of people don’t meddle with King’s
ships. You get no dew of heaven in them.
They’re going for some Spanish port, to sack a
city, belike.”</p>

<p>“Well, ’tis a pity,” said Wallis. But indignation
seized on me, and I said hotly:</p>

<p>“How is’t a pity? Do you wish to see your
own people barbarously murdered, you base
traitor!”</p>

<p>The man hung his head, grinning sourly, and
looking sideways up at my brother; who told me
to be off with my theatricals, as he called it.
Whereupon the gunner laughed. I had returned
upon him; but, from the cabin beneath, there
came the dull report of a pistol-shot.</p>

<p>I knew what it was. Ouvery had seized on
the occasion of my absence to enter the master’s
cabin, had fired at the poor invalid, and, no
doubt, murdered him.</p>

<p>And so it proved; for, on making haste to the
cabin, I saw the Englishman lay dead in his bed,
being shot through the skull into the brain.
Yea, I did very narrowly escape a like fate
myself; for that enormous and infernal villain,
Ouvery, stood crouching in shadow behind the
alley-way door, and, as I stepped by him, he let
fly at me with a second pistol that he had.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
However, I had caught a shuffling motion he
made before he fired at me, and, by an instinct,
I turned my head in the nick of time. The
bullet missed me.</p>

<p>I immediately drew my rapier, and made a
pass upon him even as he leaped on me. But
he came a little sideways, so that my point took
him on the shoulder. He gave a yelping cry,
and would have closed with me; but, quick as
a flash, I dropped, casting myself with such force
at his booted ankles, which I clutched, as
handsomely tripped him, so that he fell all his
length forward on the cabin floor. Thereupon,
before ever he could recover himself, I sprang
on top of him, and held him so that he could
not anyways stir or lift himself up. I was mad
with passion against this horrible wretch, and if
I had had a pistol in my hand, I would have
made no more to have set it to his head and
murdered him, than to have killed a rat!</p>

<p>Now, the entire affair had passed in the space
of a few moments, and the Captain had just
entered the cabin. He stepped forward, and, in
a voice that trembled, bade me stand up and let
the Quartermaster alone. But this was an order
I flatly denied to obey.</p>

<p>“Let him alone!” said I. “Why, he hath just
endeavoured as much as possibly he could to
murder me; and look you his bloody work
there on the bed!”</p>

<p>“Stop your mouth, and get up!” said he.</p>

<p>“I’ll get up,” said I, “if you’ll undertake that
he shall immediately hang at the mainmast!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>“That’s my business,” said the Captain. “Up
with you, or you shall hang there yourself!”</p>

<p>Now, Surgeon Burke was come hither, standing
at the entry of the cabin, and it came into my
thoughts to appeal from my brother unto him.
However, I perceived the foolishness of this.
“Well, have it as you will,” said I, and got to
my feet.</p>

<p>Ouvery lay some moments where he was,
gnawing the mat upon the floor with his teeth,
and growling like a dog. Thereupon he stirred,
slowly turned over on his back, and so lay
lumpish and dazed and retching after a disgusting
manner. This horrible villain did reek
of rum, so that the cabin was full of the stench
of it; and, becoming faint, I was fain to get
forth to the open air.</p>

<p>As I passed out of the cabin, Surgeon
Burke winked his eye to me, and said in my
ear:</p>

<p>“Never you mind, my boy! I’ll take him in
hand. I’ll bleed him, to the last drop!”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VIII.<br>

<small>THALASS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Coming</span> forth upon the poop, I desponded in my
mind, thinking of home and England; and the
sea, with all the beauty of its clear and flashing
blue waters, was hateful to me; yea, it cruelly
smiled on me with its shining face.</p>

<p>For I suffered loneliness, such loneliness as
exiles know; than which, to sensible men, there
is not on the earth a more cruel affliction. Here,
indeed, on this populous King’s ship, of which
my very brother was in command, I did find
myself alone with a desolation very far greater
than solitude of place. Doubtless there was
something of God in the villainous men, deep in
the hearts of them, as there is something of God
in all things; and the rest (to speak truly) is but
distortion and shadow and absence and darkness.
But I did not understand it so, and looked but
on the appearance, loathing them for their
villainous demeanour, and filthy discourse.</p>

<p>A woful suffering it was; a stifling of the
heart; a hand upon the brain, goading it to
madness; an upheaval of the deeps, breaking
up the standing surface-mould. But, amid the
stress of it all, and as with a flash of seismic
fire, there was made to me a revelation. <i>All<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
loneliness and loss were delusions; for the hearts of
all are knit together in the heart of God.</i></p>

<p>So the affliction departed from me, and I came
to myself. Yet it left me sore distraught, so
that I shook with cold like one in an ague; and
I made to go to the galley, where was a fire.</p>

<p>I descended the weather-ladder; but, coming
under the break of the poop, I caught a curious
sound of singing that proceeded from within the
alley-way.</p>

<p>I passed in, and the sound led me towards the
master’s cabin. Therein I beheld the Mosquito
Indian. He was alone with the dead Englishman,
pacing up and down before the body; and,
ever as he went, he kept crooning and chanting a
wild music, and swayed his body from side to
side, and moved his hands and arms in strange
mystic passes and convolutions.</p>

<p>Wild and inarticulate was the dirge, and the
motions, I doubt not, were but the ceremonies of
a savage fetish; but I watched and hearkened
entranced. How much of what followed is
accountable to the woful strain that recent
trials—and especially that last great trial—had
put upon me, I know not; but I think that there
was nothing earthly in that chant, or rune
(whatever it was), nothing of human artifice, and
that it proceeded from the occult heart of things.</p>

<p>I saw a vision of a boundless expanse: the
heavens loaden with masses of cloud ebon black,
the firmament illumined with a spectral light,
and, beneath it all, the <i>deep</i>! That was black
as the clouds above, and surging in billows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
(though without foam) so stupendous, that the
tops of them might not be descried, and sweeping
together with a shock and tumult such as no man
could imagine. But that which held my gaze—yea,
and nigh unseated my reason!—was the
Thing, whether brute or demon, that seemed to
be the sole denizen of the waters, swimming and
wallowing there. Merciful God! may I never
look upon the like of it again.</p>

<p>Slowly the mood and measure of the singing
changed; and now I beheld other scenes, and
other images, which concerned the mid-period of
things.</p>

<p>Again the measure changed; and, now, indeed,
I saw god-like forms and god-like deeds: and
there appeared before me (but oh, how transfigured,
how glorified!) the similitudes of those
whom I had known and loved: my mother, who
was dead, my friends and playmates as a child,
and my father, the Squire. They smiled on me;
and so near they seemed, that I stretched forth
my hand to have touched them, and would have
spoken to them, when lo! they were gone. The
Mosquito Indian had ceased from his singing,
and stood silent and motionless, with bowed
head.</p>

<p>I sprang to my feet. “Now, what manner of
man are you?” cried I. “What was it that you
sang?”</p>

<p>But he turned, and looked on me so friendly,
and yet withal so manly, grave and majestic,
that I was drawn to him. He saluted me;
solemnly we shook hands, in testimony of friendship,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
a friendship that endured to the end—yea,
to the end!</p>

<p>The Mosquito Indian was sufficiently acquainted
with the English tongue, though he did patter
it but queerly. He told me the name he went
by amongst the English, and was very proud of
it, knowing no better. For ’twas but a ridiculous
name, given him by some buffoon. So I called
him Thalassios (afterwards shortened to Thalass),
because it was a high-sounding word to please
him, and because he had been taken up from
the sea.</p>

<p>Soon after came two seamen to bear away the
dead body of the Englishman. I followed them
forth to where my brother stood awaiting them
under the break of the poop. He immediately
bade them to throw the body into the sea.</p>

<p>On this, however, the boatswain, who stood
near, putting off his cap to the Captain, begged
leave to ask whether he would not give the body
a volley for ceremony, or, at any rate, cause it to
be sewn up in a sheet or an old topsail, and a
weight fastened to it to sink it in the sea. “For,”
said he, “if you throw him in as he be, I doubt
he’ll rise and haunt us, Cap’n.”</p>

<p>But the Captain, being in a very ill-temper,
took this in dudgeon, and roughly bid the boatswain
to keep his tongue quiet, and the mariners
to act their part without more ado. This they
did—albeit but unwillingly for what the boatswain
had said about the spirit haunting the
ship—and, as the body splashed into the sea,
they looked one on another very glumly; and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
after the Captain’s back was turned, they began
to murmur against him, saying he had put a curse
upon them, and that henceforward we should
meet with no luck in our voyage, and that, in all
likelihood, the ship would be quite lost.</p>

<p>Towards evening the wind freshened very
much, so that they said evil already began to fall
upon us. But, on this coming to my brother’s
ears, he went and spoke to them, and appeased
their minds; for he showed them that the wind
was favourable to our course, and that it did but
speed them the faster to the island whither they
were bound and where they would all make
their fortunes.</p>

<p>When dark came, we had a great rippling sea,
and a high wind, which sometimes came in
pushes, forcing us to hand our topsails often.
It increased to a gale, and came so furious at
last, that we scudded under a mainsail.</p>

<p>This gave the men work enough all night.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX.<br>

<small>OUVERY DELIVERS UP THE CHART.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the next day following, I got up betimes and
went on deck.</p>

<p>The ship lurched and pitched so that I had
much ado to keep my feet. We ran before the
wind under our topsails only, driven ever onwards
with the rolling long waves of the sea and
the flying white scud-rack overhead. This all-moving
prospect put strange thoughts and whimsies
in my head, insomuch that I found I could
not endure to look upon it for long together, and
I presently returned into my cabin, and read in
a book until breakfast-time.</p>

<p>I sat down to that meal in sole company of
Surgeon Burke (my brother not yet being up);
and then I had news of Ouvery.</p>

<p>“’Tis the second time of bleeding the villain,”
says Burke, “and, if you will pass me the poached
eggs, I’ll even show you how ’tis done.”</p>

<p>“So you have carved him like a poached egg,”
answered I laughing, as I passed the dish to him.
He provided himself with great liberality; and,
between munching of the eggs, “Knives for
eggs, and lancets for villains,” says he, “there be
your remedies, look you!”</p>

<p>While he yet spoke, my brother entered, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
asked what he said about remedies. The surgeon,
putting on a countenance of the greatest gravity,
replied:</p>

<p>“I gave your brother a very good remedy
for gout in the great toe. Do you happen to
suffer from the gout, Captain?”</p>

<p>But Dick was out of humour for jest. “Tut, tut,”
said he testily, as he sat down; and immediately
after Ouvery entered the cabin.</p>

<p>I looked at Burke, who made a grimace at me.
Ouvery staggered to the table with much ado
for the weakness he was under. He was in a
most villainous temper, which the sight of me,
be sure, did not serve to sweeten! He sunk
heavily into a chair, and began to eat in sullen
silence. This wrought on my brother, and he
rapped out:</p>

<p>“So you are in the sullens again, my man!”</p>

<p>Ouvery looked up dully and heavily, like a
great beast; then a terrible light came into his
eyes, and he bounded to his feet with a roar.</p>

<p>“What!” cried he, “<i>you</i> speak to <i>me</i>....
You ... I....” His speech was stopped with
passion; but he caught up a great brass salver
and cast it at my brother with all his force. It
missed his head, and so narrowly, that the hair
was stirred upon his scalp; and on that, in an
instant, in the twinkling of an eye, both men
had drawn their pistols and fired across!</p>

<p>My brother stood untouched; but the Quartermaster
gave a great, snarling, stricken cry; and,
pitching forward upon the board, he lay there
silent and still. The ball had pierced his breast<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
in the upper parts, and he never spoke more.
Only he fixed his eyes upon my brother full of
hate and of mystery, and he took from the
pocket of his coat a leathern case and thrust it
forth before us. Then the hand of death closed
upon Ouvery; and, in a throe and convulsion
terrible to behold, his spirit passed.</p>

<p>But I took mechanically the leathern case, and
opened it. There was a strip of parchment sewn
between. ’Twas a seaman’s chart.</p>

<p>I turned to my brother, who stood holding the
smoking pistol. His face was deadly pale; and,
when I spoke to him, calling him by his name,
he laughed high and shrill, like a woman. Hereupon
Surgeon Burke gave him to drink a dram
of brandy from his flask, which steadied him.
When he was recovered, my brother took the
chart; and, having observed it awhile, he returned
it to its case, which he put within the
pocket of his coat, saying:</p>

<p>“This is what I wanted. ’Tis the chart of the
island, Burke. But what made him deliver it to
me so? For revenge? But how can that be?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X.<br>

<small>WE FALL IN WITH THE FLEET OF CAPTAIN
MORGAN. THE BUCCANEER’S HUT.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">About</span> midday the wind shifted into the north;
and, continuing very high, it blew us from our
course.</p>

<p>And, as we designed to touch at the Isle of
Porto Rico, so we could not make it, but
must go away under the great Island of
Hispaniola. Hereupon the wind chopped back
again, so that we sailed along the south side of
the island. Soon after doubling the Cape of
Lobos on the south western corner of Hispaniola,
we descried at sea a fleet of full fifteen sail, that
came towards us.</p>

<p>We misliked the appearance of them, yet held
our course—albeit the Captain caused cutlashes
and pistols to be served out, and had our ports
opened and our guns run out. When we were
come to about a quarter of a mile from those
ships, the biggest of them fired a gun, and made
a wiff to us to stand in the wind, or <i>lay to</i>, as
mariners call it. This was very uneasy to my
brother, and now he was sorry he had not borne
up his helm and scampered away while there
was yet time. Yea, it put him in so ill a temper,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
that I, who stood near him on the quarter-deck,
was fain to remove to more peaceful ground.
For, after he had ordered to obey the summons,
he fell to pacing quickly up and down; and,
as I stood a little in his path (or rather he
pretended I did), he shoved me roughly to one
side, as well as giving me a whirret on the ear
for having, as he said, obstructed him.</p>

<p>The ships came a little nearer, and then
brought to. Whereupon a dozen men put
themselves into a big canoe, or periagua, which
was towing astern of the Admiral, and pulled
towards us. They came on but slowly, for the
sea was heavy; but at length they laid aboard
of us in the waist. They were all huge brawny
seamen, sunburnt like red tiles, and very
villainous.</p>

<p>When they had made fast their boat, the
coxswain hallooed to my brother, and inquired
of him whence we came. Being answered, “From
England,” he said he was come from Captain
Morgan, who desired some provisions of bread,
pork and cheese; in recompense whereof he had
sent us some jars of excellent Peru wine.</p>

<p>Now, while the man spoke, I observed my
brother gave a start and looked earnestly upon
him; and, after he ceased, the Captain desired
he would come aboard into the ship, but that
the rest should stay in the boat. The rest,
however, began to cry out against that.</p>

<p>“What! you won’t treat us, Cap’n?” cries
one, and “Let us see what liquor you brought
from England,” cries another, and “Why, you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
skinflint shark,” quoth another, “if you drink
not with us, we’ll broach your fat hull!”</p>

<p>Hereupon these unruly rascals made to
swarm the ship’s side, and what the event of it
had been I know not; but, on a sudden, a gun
was shot off aboard the Admiral, which put a
period to their brawling. They immediately
fell quiet; and the coxswain said: “Cap’n
Morgan’s in haste, and I reckon we’d best be in
haste also. Keep you still in the boat, while I
go get the victuals. You’ll not drink rumbo this
bout!”</p>

<p>So he came up to us into the ship; and my
brother took him into his cabin, shutting the
door after, so that I know not what passed
between them.</p>

<p>But when they came out, they talked very
familiarly together; and, passing near me, I
heard my brother say:</p>

<p>“Is Jolly Peter still with you?” whence I
apprehended my brother had old acquaintance
with these people. As to what they were, I
doubted not, and now do know, they were
nothing but a swarm of pirates. On board
those fifteen vessels, indeed, was embarked the
army of Captain Henry Morgan, a name soon
to become so notorious and so dreadful. They
were going to Maracaibo.</p>

<p>When such commodities as the pirates wanted
had been laded into their boat (the jars of wine
having been taken aboard the ship in the
interim), that spokesman did very affectionately
take leave of my brother, and returned into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
boat. So they cast off and pulled away, singing
a ribald song to keep the time.</p>

<p>After parting from the pirates, we hauled our
wind and tacked in for the western shore of
Hispaniola, to re-victual the ship and fill our
water. Thereby, in the dusk of the evening, we
hit a little bay, and came to an anchor within a
mile from the shore, and lay there all night.</p>

<p>In the morning, so soon as it was light, I got
up, and went on deck to view the landfall.
Indeed, I was much inquisitive to behold this
Island of Hispaniola; for a poor crooked
mutilated man that lived in the village at home,
had given me an account thereof, acquainting
me with its varied fruitfulness and spacious and
beautiful prospects, and with the curious customs
of the hunters and planters there. He, when a
boy, had been kidnapped, and transported into
slavery on the plantations in the Isle of
St. Christopher of the Caribbee Islands. There
his master was one Bettesa, who did even excel
in cruelty among a sort of people incredibly
cruel to their slaves and servants, and used him
with such barbarity as reduced his body to that
miserable plight aforesaid. But at last, escaping
from the clutches of this inhuman monster, he
came to Hispaniola; where, after many days of
hiding and wandering up and down the country,
he fell in with a certain rich Spaniard, who
proved his benefactor. For this generous-spirited
man not only clothed and cared for
that poor fugitive, but did also defray the
charges of his passage to England on a ship<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
that was departing thither; and, moreover, he
gave him, in Spanish notes, a bounty sufficient
to his support for the rest of his days.</p>

<p>Having mounted the poop, I looked very
eagerly towards the land.</p>

<p>I beheld a low woody shore, whereon at
some points a sort of squat small trees grew
quite down to the sea, their branches so low as
to touch the water. Hugely contrasting with
these, were palm trees, being exceeding tall
(160 feet at the least) and wholly destitute of
branches to the very tops, where grew prodigious
great leaves. The trunks were of a huge
thickness and were covered with prickles.</p>

<p>Near the bottom of the bay a river flowed
into the sea, on the marshy banks whereof those
great trees did chiefly grow. In the background
the woods grew very thick and high. I saw
therein many brave cedar trees. At the
farther extremity of the bay, where the woods
were much thinner, there was a clear ground,
and in the midst a wooden hut, the roof whereof
was covered with the great leaves I have told
you of. A smoke went up from a heap near
the entry.</p>

<p>Even as I spied this hut, a man stepped forth
from within, and was followed by another. On
spying the ship, they immediately turned and
hid themselves within the woods. They
appeared to be white men, very slovenly
dressed. I took them for hunters. I observed
by the stirring of the undergrowth (albeit ’twas
but slight) that they worked their way in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
coverts of the woods alongst the shore towards
the ship. Being come over against us, they
stood concealed amongst the little thick trees
beside the sea; and there they were, when, on
my brother coming to me on the poop, I told
him what I had seen.</p>

<p>He immediately ordered the jolly-boat to be
launched and manned; and, this done, he put
himself into the boat, and so did I.</p>

<p>We pulled to the shore, making to a point
near the place where those two men lurked
amongst the trees, and where there was ground
fit to light upon. Having jumped ashore, the
Captain hallooed to these people, telling them
that he came in peace, and would by no means
harm them; only he desired some discourse
with them, and to trade with them.</p>

<p>Hereupon one of them made answer, in very
poor English, that ’twas well; they would trade
with him, and invited him to come and drink
with them in their hut. They desired, however,
that he would come alone; by reason, as they
said, their little mean hut was not fit to
entertain more. He thanked them, and told
them he would go with them.</p>

<p>Then came they out of their hiding towards
us into the open. They were a French
buccaneer (or hunter of wild bulls and cows),
and his slave. They were very slovenly
dressed, and beastly dirty. The buccaneer wore
a dirty linen shirt tucked into his breeches,
which were dyed in the blood of the beasts he
killed. He had round his middle a sailor’s belt;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
a long sheath-knife hung from the belt at the
back thereof: leggings he had of hairy boar-hide,
shoes of dressed bull-hide, and a big wide-brimmed
hat upon his head. The habit of the
slave was likewise; only without belt or shoes,
and on his head an old cloth montero-cap.
Their faces were anointed with hog’s grease to
defend them from the stings of insects.</p>

<p>My brother went with them to the hut; and
I, with Surgeon Burke, into the woods. For
Burke took the opportunity of gathering divers
medicinal herbs and woods that the place
afforded.</p>

<p>Before he left the seamen, however, he warned
them that they should by no means touch the
fruit of any tree which was not pecked by birds;
for, said he, ’twas an infallible sign that they
were not good, and evinced those little squat
trees that I had observed from the ship, which
had apples on them that did smell very sweet.
These were manchineel, or dwarf-apple trees,
the fruit whereof no bird doth eat: and, indeed,
it is so venomous that the very crabs that eat
of it are poisonous. He that eats thereof is
presently raving mad, and dead within a little
while after. Moreover, the sap of this tree doth
raise on the skin terrible red blisters, as it were
scalding water.</p>

<p>We roved up and down in the woods,
gathering Burke’s medicants; but, as the sun
climbed, we began to be tormented with those
big venomous gnats called mosquitoes, as with
other flying and creeping pests also. And,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
though the Surgeon seemed not much to mind
them, for me the incessant attacks and inroads
of the creatures became well-nigh insupportable;
but I endured them for the sake of the novelty
of the way.</p>

<p>Care was ever had of us, as we drew farther from
the seaside, not to lose touch of the river, though
we saw little of it for the dense undergrowth.</p>

<p>At length the wood became pathless, which
forced us to return. A little after, through a rift
in the undergrowth towards the river, I spied a
marvellous strange thing—or so I thought it.
For, as it should seem, a great tree-log that
floated in the river, did turn about and raise
itself as if it were a living creature. And a living
creature it really was, being nothing else but a
prodigious great cayman, or crocodile, that, thus
in semblance of a floating log, lay lurking for
its prey, waiting until some wild boar or other
came to drink thereby. This horrible beast
could have had no less than threescore foot in
length, and ten in breadth.</p>

<p>Another horrid creature I beheld before we
returned to the sea-shore. This was a sort of
huge hairy spider, very hideous. Its body was
as big as an egg; its legs were like a crab’s; four
black teeth it had, with which it snapped at me
as it ran scuttling away along a bough of a tree.
I must confess it gave me a scare, and the more
so because I thought it might be the dreadful
tarantula whose bite doth make men mad. But
Burke told me it was not venomous, and,
moreover, that I needed not be afraid of being<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
envenomed by anything in that place; for no
creature in the whole Island of Hispaniola was
venomous—no, not even snakes.</p>

<p>When we got to the boat, we found my
brother was not yet returned, and the seamen
much out of humour for the waiting. They sat
on the shore, smoking their pipes, cursing the
Captain and the mosquitoes, and viciously casting
stones at the land crabs.</p>

<p>“I ain’t going for to bide on this hell-shore
much longer,” said one, “Cap’n or no Cap’n!
Oh, to hell with them mosquiters!”</p>

<p>But Burke essayed to turn their minds, and
“Why, what’s amiss with ’em?” says he merrily,
“They need their victuals, like the rest of us.
I’ve been feeding a score of ’em since I came
ashore.”</p>

<p>“Well, you may say so, too!” returned the
seaman. “You have enough and to spare on
your bones, old sawbones!”</p>

<p>Burke laughed, and slapped him on the
shoulder. With such jolly talk did he physic
their minds, and had soon restored them to good
health. But, on a sudden, came a sound of
another sort of jollity: drunken shout and revelry
in the buccaneer’s hut; and, as he hearkened, I
saw the merriment quite go out of Burke: while
one of the seamen said harshly:</p>

<p>“Hark to ’em, boys, roystering yonder! lying
snug an’ easy on their liquor, like fine gentlemen,
whilst we be sweltering here!”</p>

<p>So the ill-temper of the seamen returned, nor
was Surgeon Burke able to mollify them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>And now the sun began to shine very hot,
and the hunger and thirst of the mosquitoes
appeared even to increase. After a further spell
of waiting (the clamour in the hut continuing),
those belated and miserable seamen did conclude
that they had endured enough, and would have
put themselves into the boat and launched forth
for the ship.</p>

<p>However, Burke proffered to go to the hut and
bring them word again, and persuaded them to
wait his return. So he went, and I with him.</p>

<p>We forced our way in haste alongst the woody
shore, whilst behind us the curses of the seamen,
in front the shouts and laughter of the revellers,
sounded in our ears; whilst the sun scorched us
like a furnace, and the humming mosquitoes
stung our bare faces. Many discomforts and
hardships of body I have suffered, but never a
one of them comparable to that shore-passage
at Hispaniola!</p>

<p>At last we came to the hut, and straightway
entered in. The drinkers sat on a couple of
chests and a stool, which were disposed about a
table on which were canakins and an earthen
jar, or bottle.</p>

<p>They had their load: the buccaneer and his
slave looked blankly up at us as we entered,
and the buccaneer broke off in singing a
drunken song; but my brother stirred not hand
or foot. He sat fallen forward upon the board,
being completely conquered with the drink.
’Twas veycou, as they call it, the beer of the
buccaneers. (It is made from Cassava root,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
from which, also, they make their meal or
flour.)</p>

<p>Surgeon Burke worked his way round the
cabin towards my brother, and, taking him
smartly by the shoulder, endeavoured to rouse
him up; but he could not.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the buccaneer began to be contrary
and truculent, and tipsily abused us in the
French tongue. But we minded him not,
so long as he contented himself with words.
When, however, he pulled out a pistol and began
to threaten us with it, Burke leant swiftly over
and snatched it from him. On that, the
buccaneer rose up to have grappled with him,
but Burke poked him smartly in the wind, which
doubled him up; and he rolled over upon the
floor, and lay there muttering, swearing, and
singing this catch:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Lolonois! Lolonois!</div>
<div class="verse">On doit suivre Lolonois!</div>
<div class="verse">Un si brave Capitaine!</div>
</div></div>

<p>As for the slave, he meddled not with us, but
sat still, drinking down a last panakin of the
veycou; whereupon he settled also, and presently
slept.</p>

<p>They being all three thus disposed and settled
on their lees, as the saying is, Surgeon Burke
desired me to return alone to the mariners, and
to bid them launch forth and bring the boat
towards a little landing-place which was over
against the hut.</p>

<p>Before I went, he anointed my face and
hands with hog’s grease (a vessel whereof he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
found in a corner), to solace my mosquito bites,
which now began to be very grievous to me.</p>

<p>So I went. When I came to the seamen, I
found that they had been joined by several
others, who had come ashore in the launch, or
longboat, and Thalass, the Mosquito Indian,
with them. This was told me by two of them
who stood by the boats, and that the rest were
gone away straggling into the woods to shoot
wild fowl, some of those who had come in the
longboat having muskets.</p>

<p>This put me to my trumps for men to manage
the boat, and I started off to see for them.
Suddenly a musket-shot rang out in the woods,
and was succeeded by a great hoarse croaking of
crows, or ravens, that rose flocking above the
tree-tops in a black multitude; and then, on a
sudden, arose a great outcry of men.</p>

<p>I set off running that way, and soon perceived
what the matter was. Two of the seamen were
locked in fierce fight. Now, this was a dreadful
thing to see; for one of the fighters was a one-armed
man—I mean, his left arm had been
amputated below the elbow, and, in lieu of an
arm, he had an iron rod with a hook to it.
With this hook had he grappled hold of the
other, and with his sailor’s knife he made fierce
clawing cuts at his face. The rest stood by,
viewing the fight.</p>

<p>However, all was over in a moment, the one-armed
man having murdered the other. When
I came up, he was rummaging in the pockets of
the dead man’s coat. He seemed to have a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
huge impatience about something he sought
after, digging amongst the cloth stuff, his face
red like fire.</p>

<p>At last he grimped out a flask of water, which
immediately he uncorked, and drank off the
contents.</p>

<p>The man was stark mad. Being one of those
who had come ashore in the second boat, he had
neither heard the Surgeon’s warning against
eating of the fruit of the manchineel, nor knew
anything at all of the danger; and, being
attracted, I suppose, by the pleasant appearance
and sweet smell of those deadly apples, he had
tasted and eaten of them. Whereupon such
huge drought and uncontrollable thirst seized on
the poor maddened wretch, as inflamed him to
that dreadful act of ferocity I have told you of.
Now madness seized hold on him indeed,
insomuch that he ran up and down, roaring and
cutting the air and the trees with his knife. But
the boatswain, who stood by, quickly put a
period to his misery by running him through
with his hanger.</p>

<p>After this I told the boatswain what Burke
desired, and he mustered half a dozen of that
company, and brought them with me to the
boats. We put ourselves into the longboat,
launched forth, and pulled towards the farther
point of the bay, where we found Burke without
the hut, stirring the heap of tobacco-leaves that
was laid up before the entry for a protection
against the mosquitoes. We went ashore to
him, and with him into the hut.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>The jolly company lay in the same posture,
all three slumbering. Burke bid our men to
remove the Captain into the boat, and they
began to set about it. But, while this was doing,
the buccaneer stirred, and presently woke up;
and, having looked stupidly round, he enquired
who we were and what we did in his habitation.</p>

<p>He was answered pleasantly by Burke, who
said:</p>

<p>“Bon jour, monsieur, j’espère que vous avez
bien dormi. Il faut que nous vous quittions.
Mais je suis vraiment très fâché de ne plus voir
votre beau visage!”</p>

<p>But this was taken very ill by the buccaneer,
who started up, crying:</p>

<p>“Insolent! maraud d’Anglais! petit gros
homme! Mort Dieu! vous me le paierez.”</p>

<p>And he felt for his knife.</p>

<p>The Surgeon, however, had removed it whilst
he slept; and, when he understood this, he would
have fallen upon Burke with his fist. But one
of the seamen who stood near, knocked him on
the head with the butt of his pistol, which felled
him senseless.</p>

<p>Hereupon, waked by the scuffle, the slave
began to cry out, and then roared for quarter, as
a seaman lifted his pistol to have served him
after the same manner as his master. But Burke
made the man desist.</p>

<p>Burke’s care now was to get the Captain (who
continued to slumber) into the boat, and thence
all back into the ship again; and this he did
effect, mainly by reason of his foresight in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
absconding amongst the bushes the buccaneer’s
store of veycou before our men came to the hut.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>That night I took an opportunity of questioning
Thalass about his knowledge of the Haunted
Island and acquaintance with those pirates.
But, though he answered me very frankly and
told me what possibly he could, I learnt not
much; for the eyes of a poor Indian are not
as an European’s, and here were strange and
unfamiliar things.</p>

<p>It appeared, also, that Thalass had never
stayed on the island for any considerable space
of time, but used to go out on one pirate vessel
or another (for, it seems, there were two or
three), and, even at such times as he was on the
island, he kept himself aloof from the rest,
living in the woods.</p>

<p>Thalass told, indeed, of great pieces of
ordnance and fortifications; and of that subterraneous
place spoken of by the Englishman.
Of the terrible old man the Englishman had
called the Doctor, he could tell me nothing but
what I knew. He had heard of the ghost, but
had never seen it.</p>

<p>For the rest, he had consorted with the
Englishman and made great friends with him;
and at last (being taken out together on the
same ship), they had contrived to escape in the
cock-boat, and (after many days, and when such
provisions as they had were long spent) had
fallen in with our ship in manner related.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>I asked him how first he came to consort with
those pirates; he answered, that, being “many
sleeps ago at Quibo,” there came one of their
ships, and he had gone away with them.</p>

<p>Next day I gave the Captain and Surgeon
Burke an account of all that I had learnt of the
Haunted Island, as well from the Englishman
as from the Mosquito Indian.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI.<br>

<small>THE MAD MAROON.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> all the space of our voyage from the Island
of Hispaniola, round about the great hump of
America southwards, and through the Straits of
Magellan into the South Sea, there fell out
nothing worthy of remark—nothing, I mean,
sufficiently noteworthy or fit to be set down in
this history.</p>

<p>Accordingly, passing over all this while, I
come to the day, when, having beat up round
the Cape, at nine leagues’ distance we laid the
Isle of Juan Fernandez.</p>

<p>This island is very high, and at a distance
appears like a rough rocky pyramid cut off at
the top with a canopy of clouds. But when we
were got closer to the south side, we perceived
the shore was woody. We had a constant
breeze; and, about sundown, stood in past a
lesser island (being nothing but scraggy and
barren rock), into a bay, and came to an anchor at
the distance of a furlong from shore.</p>

<p>Thus we had lain not long, when we perceived
a man made signals to us from the shore,
hallooing and waving a sort of a ragged banner
on a staff. He appeared to be a wild figure of a
man, but the light was failing, and whether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
European or Indian we could not tell. And, as
to what he said, a very great concourse of seals
on the shore did keep up so great a barking
noise that we could make nothing of it.</p>

<p>I asked the Captain whether he would send
off a boat, but he told me “No, not until the
morning,” and immediately commanded, that on
no pretext, should any man leave the ship.
Notwithstanding, being restless and full of
curiosity to know who and what that strange
man on the island might be, I resolved to get
to the shore if possibly I could, and began to
cast about for a way.</p>

<p>Had the cock-boat been afloat, it had been
easy if I waited until night came; for the sea was
smooth, and the men did not use to keep a good
watch. But only the jolly-boat lay in the water,
and that I could not manage. She lay under
our quarter.</p>

<p>But, when I saw how she tugged at her lashing
towards the shore, I took a thought; for I
perceived, that, if the tide held until night, I
might safely trust to drive ashore in her, and,
peradventure, get off unseen. Concluding, therefore,
to make the attempt if the tide held, I
disposed myself to wait the time.</p>

<p>At last it became quite dark; whereupon I
stole softly into the great cabin (which, by good
luck, I found empty), stepped to a port-hole
and looked without.</p>

<p>The shine of a bright star just overhead
showed me that the jolly-boat held in the same
posture, and that the tide still flowed. I opened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
the port, and, scrambling up, made a leap for
the jolly-boat. I lighted on my toes in the
stern-sheets, making but little noise; and, having
recovered my balance, I had soon cut through
the lashing with my knife. Unseen by any man
on the ship, I drove quickly towards the shore.</p>

<p>At length the boat grounded on the sandy
bottom; and, catching up a rope that was
fastened in the bows, I boldly adventured to
leap ashore. But hereupon I came nigh to be
scared out of my wits; for, falling foul of an
obstacle that lay there below, I rolled over,
clutching with my fingers a shaggy hide, and a
huge creature rose up beside me, being quite six
times bigger than a seal, and did roar like a lion.
And, indeed, a lion I took him to be; for his
head, as I saw it, was exactly like a lion’s.
However, he shambled away, and left me; and
now I know ’twas a creature called a sea-lion.</p>

<p>This rencounter shook my spirit; so that,
having got to my feet, I stood quaking with fear
of the darkness, or rather of unknown terrors the
darkness might hold concealed. And, being
also very cold and wet from my immersion in
the breaking waves, I began hugely to repent
of my coming hither, and devoutly wished it had
been possible to return—nay, I was ready to
halloo to the ship; but shame withheld me.</p>

<p>Now, whilst I thus stood, a voice spoke to me
almost at my feet.</p>

<p>“Ha! little pilgrim,” came the voice. “Ha!
little pilgrim!” ’Twas harsh and grating like a
rusty lock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>Immediately after, a man rose up from an
empty water-hole that lay near in my path.</p>

<p>He was a small man, and very wild looking,
having a shock of towselled red hair and beard
that nigh covered his face, and clothed in rags
and patches. He stood clutching the staff and
tattered banner which we had observed from the
ship, and peered in my face with his glittering eyes.</p>

<p>“Ha! little pilgrim,” cried he again. “What is
your sin, shipmate? What ha’ been your offence
against the Righteous?”</p>

<p>I perceived he was stark mad. “I have slain
a man in a duel,” said I, humouring him.</p>

<p>“Ha! ’twas a sore offence,” cried he, and began
to wave his banner above my head, “’Twas
a black sin, Jesus ha’ mercy! ’Twas a most
grievous transgression. Now, look’e hereon, shipmate!
Behold, it shall be as an ensign on an hill!”</p>

<p>Hereupon he turned from me, and made with
great bounds towards a high boulder which stood
at a few yards’ distance. He set the staff
in a cleft of the rock, crying: “Behold the
ensign of the Lord! Look’e on the banner,
shipmate, and say after me, ‘Father I have
sinned afore Heaven and afore Thee, and am no
more worthy to be called Thy son.’”</p>

<p>A gust of wind took the banner, stretching it
out, and I beheld upon it the Royal device of
Spain. I began to repeat the words; but he
took me up short.</p>

<p>“Gramercy!” cried he, “Look on the ensign,
can’t you? Look on the ensign! Now, over
agen!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>I perceived by the look in his rolling eyes that
he was on the verge of a frenzy-fit, and I hasted
to humour him to the letter.</p>

<p>When I had said and acted to his satisfaction,
he took the banner in his hand again, and began
to wave it over my head, and absolved me (as
he called it) in a hotch-potch jargon of Scriptural
and nautical phrase. Madness makes ever a
rueful picture, but the shape this man’s took was
extremely scandalising to me; and it may easily
be believed, that now I repented more than ever
of having come on shore, and would have given
a great deal to have been safe back on the
ship again. But there was worse to come.</p>

<p>For, when this business of absolving me was
over, the madman took another notion; and,
having muttered to himself once and twice, he, on
a sudden bawled out:</p>

<p>“It is written, ‘He that sheddeth man’s blood,
by man shall his blood be shed.’”</p>

<p>Hereupon he lowered fiercely round at me,
clapt his hand behind him, and plucked from his
belt a long macheat. At the sudden sight of the
bare blade glittering in the dark night, I started
back, and then stepped quickly to one side as
the madman made a lunge on me.</p>

<p>Thus I eluded his intent, and immediately
after took to my heels, running blindly in the
darkness. I heard him close behind me, the
furious haste he made, his quick pants, mingled
with curses. I struck my feet against stones; I
bruised my body against the jagged sides of
boulders; every moment I expected to feel that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
murdering great knife come crashing in my
bones.</p>

<p>Suddenly I tumbled into a water-hole, hurting
my ankle (though I scarce did feel it); but
got out, set my back to a great boulder that
stood near, drew my rapier, and made shift to
parry a lunge in the nick of time.</p>

<p>And, as the madman blundered in on me with
the impulse of the blow, I caught his wrist in a
desperate gripe, and twisted his arm round, until
he dropped his knife, roaring with pain. Thereupon
I set my point to his breast, and had him
at my will.</p>

<p>“Up with your arms,” said I smartly, “or I’ll
run you through!”</p>

<p>He was not so mad but he understood, and
held up his arms immediately; but his eyes
kept harking down to his knife, until, with a
kick of my unhurt foot, I removed it out of reach.</p>

<p>“Now,” said I, speaking very slowly, “you
see, don’t you, that you are quite helpless.
If you do not exactly as I bid you, I
shall run you through the heart. I bid you
instantly to drop upon the ground and lay quite
flat.”</p>

<p>And I advanced my point until it pressed
upon his breast-bone.</p>

<p>“Ay, ay!” said he, and immediately cast
himself flat.</p>

<p>So far, so well; but what was next to do I
knew not: I had no cord or rope to have bound
him; nor withal could I securely have attempted
it, for he was stronger than I. Moreover, my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
hurt ankle now began to pain me much. There
appeared nothing for it but to bide on guard
until day, when I trusted to be succoured from
the ship. Accordingly, with a rueful mind and
a tired body, I disposed myself to the miserable
vigil.</p>

<p>For a pretty long while the man lay quiet
and perfectly still, whilst I took up my posture,
as easy as I could, on a ledge of the rock, having
my drawn sword in my hand. I marvelled that
he spoke not; and kept the better look-out,
lest he should contemplate a surprise. At
length I could endure the silence no longer,
and brake it.</p>

<p>“My man,” said I, “how came you here on
this island?”</p>

<p>I spoke at adventure, not expecting any
reasonable reply. I was, therefore, startled and
perfectly astonished when he said:</p>

<p>“I was marooned, Cap’n. ’Twas pirates
marooned me.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said I, “and how long ago was that?”</p>

<p>“’Tis many a year—ay, many a year!” said
he. “It mought be ten, it mought be twelve.
Many a weary year. I lived like a beast, all
alone, alone!”</p>

<p>“What was your ship,” said I, “that was
taken by these pirates?”</p>

<p>“What was my ship?” said he. “Why, I was
aboard of ’em. The Doctor sent us——”</p>

<p>“The Doctor!” exclaimed I, breaking in on
him. “What Doctor? Not the master of the
Haunted Island?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>“Ay,” said he, sitting up, and staring on me—his
face had turned deadly pale, and his voice
quavered—“but you a’n’t come from him, lad?
No, no, not from him! You a’n’t. Say you
a’n’t!”</p>

<p>“Be easy as to that,” said I. “No, I am not
come from the Doctor.”</p>

<p>“Then how know you of him?” said he.
“How? How? Never lie to me, on your soul!
The Lord do the like to you if you deal falsely.
Behold, I am come in the name of the Lord!
In the Lord’s name!...”</p>

<p>But I forbear to set down the things he
uttered in the frenzy-fit that thus, on a sudden,
seized on him. Nor did he return again to
reason; but, all night long, lay silent or raving;
whilst I kept watch and ward.</p>

<p>Towards dawn he slept: but I dared not
take any rest myself, nor leave watching of him
for a moment. Indeed, the pain of my hurt
served to keep me awake. In that hour, while
it was yet dark, came the noise of a commotion
on board the ship, being occasioned (as I learnt
after) by the discovery that the jolly-boat, and I,
also, were gone; and, so soon as it became light,
I gladly beheld the longboat manned and
making for the shore. My brother sat in the
stern-sheets.</p>

<p>They landed below the jolly-boat, which lay
high and dry, for the tide had ebbed; whereupon
I hallooed to them.</p>

<p>“Is that you, Frank?” cried the Captain;
and, when I stepped from behind the boulder<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
and he spied me, he immediately threw himself
into a great rage, or so it appeared, rushing to
me, and threatening me with his fists and crying:</p>

<p>“What do you mean by this, you whelp, you?
Do you dare to flout my orders? If you were
not a boy, I would hang you up at the yard!”</p>

<p>I had taken this very ill, and (being in a fume
from my painful and tedious vigil), had resisted
and outbraved him to his face; but, from a sign
which he contrived to make me, I perceived
what he would be at, that this fury was all a
pretence and he did it for the sake of the men.
Accordingly, taking the hint, I put on a very
humble, repentant bearing towards him.</p>

<p>Now, whilst he rated me as above (the seamen
standing by), the mad maroon awoke from sleep,
and, sitting up, began to stare fixedly on him.
This put my brother out, so that he stumbled
in his speech, and broke off to ask me what the
man was. So I gave him an account of all that
had fallen out. When I had ended, he ordered
the man to be bound; which immediately was
performed, he offering but little obstruction.
Hereupon we went all to the longboat, the
madman, who now began to mutter and rave
after his manner, being haled along by two
seamen, and I borne by two others, for I could
not walk. Nay, though they carried me gently,
I suffered much pain.</p>

<p>On coming to the launch, they took out
water-jars which they had brought ashore, and
put into her myself and the crazy man, who
ceased not to call down curses on us in his mad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
religious jargon. On this account, the seamen
had much fun out of the poor antic, jeering and
mocking him; but, however, this was displeasing
to the Captain, and suddenly he turns on one
of them, crying:</p>

<p>“Be done with this, you yokel fool! You’re
like some silly schoolboy teasing a village idiot!
Be done with it! Be done with it!”</p>

<p>I liked this well; but the chidden seaman
liked it not at all. He glared at the Captain;
who glared back at him. Thereupon, sinking
his head, the man looked round upon his fellows,
but got no sort of encouragement from them;
for they held silent, looking this way and that.
So he thought it convenient to hold his peace.</p>

<p>I was rowed with the crazy man to the ship.
He was laid bound in the forecastle. Surgeon
Burke took charge of me; and, having looked
at my hurt ankle, he told me I must lay up
for at least a fortnight.</p>

<small>THE WARNING SEA.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> parted from the Isle of Juan Fernandez
after two days, which we stayed to fill our water,
cut firewood, and drive goats.</p>

<p>My confined state was very irksome to me,
after the freedom I had enjoyed on board and
the daily fare of new and strange experiences.
However, I employed the time pleasantly enough
in learning the Spanish language, as much as I
could of it, by means of an old torn copy of
<i>Don Quixote</i> and a Spanish dictionary, which I
chanced to find in a corner; and, indeed, got
much diversion from that merry and sorrowful
tale.</p>

<p>Sometimes my brother came to me; though
he stayed not long. And Surgeon Burke
stood my friend throughout; coming to chat
with me often, and giving me news of anything
remarkable that might have happened in
the interim. Notably, he told me, that my
brother had questioned the mad maroon (at a
time when he was in his right mind) of the
Haunted Island; but, that, on learning we were
thither bound, such huge terror seized on the
poor man, that, rather than carry him to the
island, he besought the Captain on his knees<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
to cause him to be shot, or thrown into the sea,
and was immediately after transported with a
violent raving crazy-fit; that on the morrow he
was not to be found anywhere in the ship.
’Twas supposed he had made a shift to loosen
the cords that bound his limbs, and, having got
up on deck, had jumped overboard and drowned
himself in the sea.</p>

<p>“Either this, also, was part of his madness,”
said Burke, “or else there’s something monstrous
terrible on the Haunted Island!”</p>

<p>“But did he not fright the men?” said I. “I
mean, about going to the Haunted Island.”</p>

<p>“Why, bless you, no!” says he. “They put
it down to his whimsies.”</p>

<p>This was in the first week after our departure
from Juan Fernandez. We had made good way
on our course, which was S.W. having a brave
settled gale at W.N.W. On the morrow, however,
when I awoke, I was sensible the ship was
tost like an eggshell, as, indeed, she was, in a
high cockling sea.</p>

<p>It held all day. Late in the afternoon, Burke,
coming into the cabin, was thrown headlong with
a sudden violent lurching of the ship. I laughed
to see him go rolling over (being a little round
man); but he got to his feet with a very long
countenance, which rather abashed me. Yet
was it not like Burke to take umbrage, and I
presently perceived that that was not the matter
with him. He was concerned in his mind about
the men.</p>

<p>They were, it seemed, in a most villainous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
temper, by reason of the work they had had with
the ship. For, ever since one o’clock in the
morning, when the wind came to N.E. and the
sea swelled, they had not found so much as a
moment’s respite. First (the ship having been
put under a forecourse and spritsail), the foresail
split. Then, when the yard had been lowered
and that matter remedied, the standing rigging
gave way in several places. That having been
mended, the wind began to whiffle between all
points; whereupon the Captain set them a brave
dance up and down the rigging in his eagerness to
make way. At length, the wind blowing and
whiffling worse than ever, our main-course blew
to pieces; “and now the mizzen’s given way!”
said Burke, holding up his hands.</p>

<p>“It’s a scurvy business,” said I, “but I see
not why you should be put out about the men.
Let them be! They’ll come about anon, like
wind and weather. In my opinion, wind and
weather are rather to be feared than so many
silly seamen!”</p>

<p>“And your opinion is out,” said Burke tartly.
“You’ve never experienced a mutiny aboard
ship, have you? No; well, pray that you never
may! A mutiny is what we’ve been in fear of
all along; and, it seems, what that miserable
maroon gave out about the Haunted Island
stuck with the men after all, and now it works.
And there goes a word among them that this
blast and hurly-burly, and coil of trouble with
the sails, is a warning from God Almighty that
we should go no farther on this voyage; and,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
when seamen have stuck on this sort of notion,
you may spare your labour and let be: not all
your endeavours, nor arguments, nor persuasions,
nor appeals, look you, will avail to hale ’em off!
And now,” says he, “I must go; the Captain
may have need of me.”</p>

<p>With that, he departed, leaving me to conjure
up dismal forebodings, to the music of the
groaning ship, the stamping of the mariners, the
brunt and welter of the roaring seas, and the
continual shrieking of the winds.</p>

<p>Thus I sat hearkening for any sound that might
betoken a rising of the men, with intent to sally
forth on the first sign or appearance of an alarm.
However, I heard nothing; and at the customary
time the ship’s boy came to light the lantern
and bring my supper, which made me conclude
there was no mutiny so far. The ship laboured
more than ever now, and the boy told me that
we lay a hull in a huge roaring sea, in drizzling
rain and very dark weather.</p>

<p>I turned into my hammock, and composed
myself to sleep, yet with small expectation
thereof. However, I slept very well until the
morning.</p>

<p>When I woke, I found Burke was come into
the cabin. He told me that the wind, the sea,
and the disaffection of the mariners were sunk
together.</p>

<p>“I told you that it would be so,” said I; but,
“Not so fast, young cockerel!” says he. “It
would not have been so, and the men had
mutinied beyond doubt, but for a curious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
occurrence and a piece of good fortune, which the
Captain had the wit and sagacity to lay hold on.</p>

<p>“’Twas so: in the mid-watch, after the wind
came to W. and sunk, and the ship recovered
her course, the men came together in a gang,
and the boatswain, stepping to the Captain,
begged him, on behalf of the whole ship’s
company, to bear up the helm and proceed no
farther in that course. The Captain enquired
what they found amiss with the course, and was
answered, that, in the blustering weather, and
in the many lets and hindrances they had met
withal they did clearly perceive the hand of
Almighty God warning them against going on.
The Captain used all persuasions to turn them
from this opinion; but he had as well laboured
to have turned the wind. When he found he
could not oversway them, he told them plainly
that he would not leave his course on any considerations.
‘Nor,’ added he, ‘would you wish
me to do it, if you but knew, or had any notion
of, what a rich and kingly treasure is there!’”</p>

<p>“Thereupon the men withdrew to the forecastle
to consult. Now, a little after, while they
thus stood, came a violent furious tornado, which
went roaring past our stern at about our ship’s
length away. On that, without a moment’s
hesitation, the Captain goes to the men, and,
‘Look ’e here, my lads,’ says he, ‘you saw that
tornado? Well, where would we ha’ been,
think you, had it struck us? Answer me that!’</p>

<p>“‘Why, Cap’n,’ says the boatswain, ‘I suppose
we would ha’ foundered.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>“‘Ay,’ says the Captain, returning sharply on
him, ‘I suppose we would! And now hear
another thing, if I had borne up the helm, as
you desired me to do, where would we ha’ been
then? Why, bang in the middle of the tornado,
ye lunkheads! Now, where’s your warning hand
of God Almighty—heh?’ says he. Ay, that
brother of yours hath a headpiece to his shoulders,
look you, Frank!”</p>

<p>“And so, then,” said I, “that turned them.”</p>

<p>“Turned them? Why, guinea-pigs in a cage
aren’t more tractable! And, talking of guinea-pigs,”
says the waggish fellow, smiling on me,
“Talking of guinea-pigs, I have to tell ye, you
are now freed from your cage, and may quit
your bed and cabin.”</p>

<p>You may be sure I was glad enough to hear
this; and, Burke helping me, I rose up, and went
stiffly out to the deck.</p>

<p>The day was clear and bright, with white
scud-cloud flying towards the west; the sea much
fallen. The ship sailed heavily, making a due
west way. Her topworks were loose, but she
had sustained no leaks. The Captain took the
sun, and seemed to be much satisfied with
the observation.</p>

<p>It came out, indeed, that, instead of hindering
us, the blustering weather had given us great
heaves on our course.</p>

<p>The wind and sea held favourable; and some
ten days after, by Ouvery’s chart, we should be
within forty leagues, more or less, of the Haunted
Island.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">About</span> four o’clock after noon, the look-out
man in our foreyard cried:</p>

<p>“Land a-weather bow.”</p>

<p>This put a strange spirit into the mariners,
half eager, half fearful; as might be seen from
their restless demeanour and furtive converse
one with another. And, as it seemed to me, the
very ship began to sail faster, straining and
leaping, drenching her beakhead. Soon we
began to have other warrants than the testimony
of the look-out man that land was nigh, tokens
in the air and sea: a gaudy landfowl came and
perched on a yardarm; a piece of rockweed
drove along by the ship’s side.</p>

<p>The sun sank; but the air was clear like
crystal, and suddenly a mariner standing in the
bows, sang out:</p>

<p>“There it be! There it be! I spies it.”</p>

<p>And immediately I descried the land, as a
blue mist, as a cloud no bigger than a man’s
hand, close aboard the horizon.</p>

<p>“Ay, there it be! there it be!” cried a score
of voices. “There be the island!”</p>

<p>And my brother answered from the quarter-deck:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>“Right, my lads! Yonder’s the island!
There you’ll make all your fortunes, my jolly
boys!”</p>

<p>They gave a great huzza on this; but, as it
died away, one called to my brother, saying:</p>

<p>“Begging your pardon, Cap’n, but me and
my shipmates be particular curious to know
whether what that mad maroon told of had any
truth in’t. I means, about there being a ghost
on that island!”</p>

<p>But the Captain answered with a great scoff
and bluster.</p>

<p>“A ghost on the island!” says he, “Ghost of
my grandmother! They do say that there’s a
man in the moon; but you can only see the
face of him. Now, as touching this man in the
moon, what I am <i>particular curious</i> to know, is:
where hath he his body and his legs?”</p>

<p>This brought much laughter upon that seaman,
and stopped his mouth. But Burke nipped my
arm; and, when the merry din subsided, he
blew it up again.</p>

<p>“Where be his body and his legs, Captain?”
roared he. “Why, he hath lent ’em to the ghost
on the island!”</p>

<p>Meanwhile the island enlarged itself in our
view, and the colour of it changed to purple.</p>

<p>’Twas very long and high. It lay north and
south.</p>

<p>Still we made in, and soon towering cliffs
appeared, with jagged ridges of hills on the high
land.</p>

<p>But now the light began to fade, so that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
island could no longer be seen. Darkness fell
apace; and, as it did so, the wind sunk and died
quite away. Hereupon, within two miles of the
shore, we anchored the ship.</p>

<p>Now, at this time, and, indeed, from a good
while previous, we heard from the land a
booming sound, which at first we took to
be nothing but the clamour of breakers; but
Thalass told us it was the voice of a great
waterfall from the lofty cliff.</p>

<p>I supped that night with my brother and with
Surgeon Burke in the great cabin, and I expected
the Captain would speak of his plans. But, on
the contrary, he spoke scarce a word, seeming
to brood in his mind. Only, having risen from
his chair, he told us that he went to give
orders for our ports to be opened and our
guns run out, new-primed and double-shotted;
for, that, though it was unlikely any menace
or danger from the island would come up in
the night, yet he thought it convenient to be
prepared.</p>

<p>I thought my brother was become thinner of
late; his face was pale, and had a drawn, grim
look; and, though he was yet but young,
methought he had gotten grey hairs.</p>

<p>After he had gone, Burke and I sat awhile over
the board, talking of the mysterious chances of
the morrow; I say <i>of the morrow</i>, for neither
did we anticipate anything to happen during the
night.</p>

<p>At last we rose, and went on deck, towards
the end of the first watch. There all hands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
were gathered. They stood most by the starboard
bulwarks forward, and in the waist, gazing
upon the island, which, the moon being risen,
appeared like a shadow on the sea.</p>

<p>They were strangely silent. I became
sensible of a tenseness amongst them. If any
man spoke, ’twas in a whisper, or scarce more
than a whisper; as if terror possessed their
minds. And now, no doubt, they recalled, and
believed implicitly, every word and dark terrible
hint spoken of the Haunted Island by the mad
maroon. To make a clean breast, I must confess,
I began to be uneasy myself.</p>

<p>The wind was fallen to a flat calm, the sea
moved with a sluggish, and yet fitful motion—as
if it, too, were uneasy, and affrighted, and unable
to sleep. The moon was at the full, yet having
none of the extraordinary brightness common in
these latitudes, and showing small and dull, as
through a veil of crape. It shone upon the
ship, and upon the stagnant sea, with a pale
dank light, that had mystery in it, and waiting,
and devilry.</p>

<p>Suddenly it began to grow darker. Darkness
closed in on all sides around like a quivering
black curtain. I looked up. As far as eye
could see, a thickening layer of cloud closed
slowly upon the moon.</p>

<p>The tension increased. All felt that something
was about to happen. No man so much
as whispered now, or stirred hand or foot; I
could hear the beating of my heart. And while
we thus stood, the apparition came.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>“<i>Hist! Hist! Merciful God!</i>”</p>

<p>It was a shrouded human figure whose stature
reached the clouds; and it arose and stood forth
upon the shore of the island. The flowing
garments of the figure were white like snow, and
glistening.</p>

<p>For a moment, it stood motionless; then,
as it should seem, a covering fell from the head
of it, revealing a visage that sometimes, even
now, returns to me in sleep, and is a terror of
the midnight, so that I start from that nightmare
shaking and gasping, a scream upon my
lips!</p>

<p>The eyes of the figure were fixed upon us.
We stood like men turned to stone.</p>

<p>There was a little ship’s boy there, and his
reason was not of strength to bear it; so that
he gave a shriek at that prodigy, and went stark
raving mad. And on that, my brother collected
himself.</p>

<p>He looked upon the poor crazy lad, and then
away again at the horrid thing to starboard;
and he rapped out an oath that was one of the
pleasantest sounds I ever heard. Then, swinging
round upon the horror-struck mariners,
“To quarters!” roared he. “To quarters, Wallis!
Give it a broadside, the devil’s thing! Smite
it in its devil’s face! Give it iron—iron, by
thunder!”</p>

<p>And immediately, like men loosed from
enchantment, they sprang to life. They stamped
upon the deck; they shouted curses and defiance,
shaking their clenched fists to the island and the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
apparition there; and, when the gunners went
in a frenzy of haste to their stations, the rest
followed them, helping and exhorting them in
the work.</p>

<p>Soon all was in readiness, the gunners standing
to their pieces, the muzzles of twenty cannon
trained upon the Thing, which continued to stand
motionless.</p>

<p>And now the command was given. The ship
leaped and leaped again as the broadside blazed
along, and volume upon volume of cannon-smoke
hid all.</p>

<p>We strained our eyes.</p>

<p>Gradually the smoke lifted. <i>The figure was
standing as before!</i></p>

<p>And as that horrid countenance came forth
again in view, fixedly looking on us, their terror
returned upon the mariners, now come all up on
deck again. Dazed with fear, they stood huddled
together, every man clinging to his mate.</p>

<p>Suddenly the Captain cried:</p>

<p>“Make sail!” But his voice was shrill and
small; and, glancing to starboard, he screamed:</p>

<p>“Haste! haste! Make sail! Cut the cable!”</p>

<p>Again the mariners did his bidding. Gibbering
with affright, they swarmed aloft, crowding
on sails; whilst one run and hacked through the
cable with his hanger.</p>

<p>Suddenly the glimmering light cast by the
phantom went out. The figure had disappeared.
A cry arose, and the men on the
yards and rigging ceased from their panic
work.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>But only for a moment; and soon every sail
was set, and every stitch of canvas got on her
that our yards would spread. But there was no
wind—no, not so much as to lift an ensign!</p>

<p>But there was a current run very swift
to the southward, in a line with the shore,
and the ship drove into the path of it, and
began to be borne along with it. It carried us
about two miles, when it took a turn, swirling
gradually round to the shore. Hereupon we
let go our sheet-anchor (it was the bower-cable
that had been cut); but the bottom would
not hold.</p>

<p>Then began the mariners to cry out, saying
it was the dreadful phantom did this, putting an
influence on the sea; and they did murmur
against the Captain, casting baleful glances at
him, muttering and whispering one to another,
because he had ensnared them and brought
them to this place. But he regarded it not,
standing motionless, with knit brows.</p>

<p>Suddenly a man, being perfectly beside himself
with rage and terror, laid hold on a carpenter’s
tool that had been left near him on the
deck; and made directly towards the Captain,
brandishing the weapon and charging like a
maddened bull.</p>

<p>And then, beyond doubt, my brother had
miserably perished; but Thalass chanced to be
standing by, and, thrusting forth his foot as he
passed, he effectually tripped up the infuriated
man, so that he stumbled and pitched forward
upon the deck. But—and here was a horrid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>
thing—the man’s weapon was jerked quite about
in his fall, and he fell full upon the point of it,
and was pierced through. Whereupon, being in
an agony, and quite hopeless of recovery, the
Captain shot him dead with his pistol.</p>

<p>Yet was the episode for good one way; for
the dreadful sight of it did so control and deaden
the hearts of the rest, that they were withheld
from mutineering (as, beyond doubt, they had
been about to have done), and from murdering
the Captain.</p>

<p>The rage and disaffection of the mariners were
abated—but not their terror! No whit less
eager were they to be gone from this place, and
to put many a sea-league betwixt them and the
Haunted Island. And, as it came home to them,
that, though the darkness concealed it, they
drove on still nearer to the island, their panic
returned upon them, and they made desperate
endeavours to anchor the ship. At last it held—in
but ten fathoms water!</p>

<p>Were we, then, gotten in so near to the shore,
or was it shoal-water?</p>

<p>We could hear no sound of breakers; but the
sea was flat calm, and the clamour of the waterfall
still sounded, though less loud. We waited,
huddled together like terrified children, peering
into the thick darkness.</p>

<p>In that hour, my brother stepped to me, and
took me apart beyond hearing of the rest; and,
looking upon him, I saw with a pang how grey
and old he was become.</p>

<p>He began to speak tense and low.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>“Boy,” said he, “take my hand. So. Now
say that you forgive me for all.”</p>

<p>But, as I put my hand in his and tried to speak,
he looked upon me long and tenderly as he had
never looked before, and I think he knew it was
the farewell, and that he would not be alive when
the night was passed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV.<br>

<small>THE CUT CABLE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Whether</span> my brother had spoken more, I
know not; for, on a sudden, there came a stir
and commotion among the men, who began to
move towards us in a gang.</p>

<p>When they were come near, one said hoarsely:</p>

<p>“Cap’n, we hears shore-breakers. Hearken
now! hearken to it!”</p>

<p>I listened, and above the clamour of the waterfall,
I thought I did, indeed, hear the sound of
breaking waves. But the seaman on a sudden
cried:</p>

<p>“We be nearer shore! Nearer shore, the
Lord ha’ mercy on ’s!”</p>

<p>“Nearer shore!” cries the Captain. “Hath
the anchor, peradventure, come home in a duck-pond?
Why, you lunkhead, she is fast as iron
locks!”</p>

<p>“Then look there!” said the other, and
pointed down upon the sea forward.</p>

<p>The thick darkness, which had held until now
with no rift in the cloud-pall, was broken. A
shaft of moonshine took the sea hard by our
cutwater; and the Captain, following it, gave a
great start. <i>The ship was in motion again!</i></p>

<p>“Driving, by thunder!” cried he; and, running
to the head, he laid hold of the cable, and hauled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
on it. It began to come in slack and easy; and
soon a loose end appeared. <i>The cable had been
severed!</i></p>

<p>My brother stood motionless, the dripping
rope’s end dangling from his hand. Then he
swung fiercely round upon the Mosquito Indian.</p>

<p>“If this be your handywork, my man,” cried
he; “if I do but half trace it to your hands, you
shall hang—you shall hang at that yardarm!”</p>

<p>But Thalass reared himself haughtily up, and
looked him in the face; and the Captain was
abashed.</p>

<p>He turned to the men. “My lads,” said he
weightily and slow, “whether there be treachery
here I know not. Look you to that! Look
well to it if you’ld live, and drag out the villainous
man! As for me, witness all, I am contriving
and fending for you no less than for
myself! If any man have a grievance against
me, let him out with it now. Ay!” cried he
hotly, as they began to press upon him, “and if
you’ld depose me, do even so; I care not a jot!
You’re but a scullion crew. Choose ye another
captain: I grow weary of it! Weary of it!”</p>

<p>His challenge rang loud; but they held silent
while many moments passed; and, when one
of them said humbly, “We make no quarrel
against you, Cap’n; we be mazed men,” the rest
answered with a great heartiness. Yet took they
heed of what the Captain had said concerning
treachery, looking narrowly one upon another;
and there fell a dispute and questioning among
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>The conclamation was broken off suddenly, on
a man crying out that we were come among the
very breakers of the shore; and scarce his voice
had died away, when, with a lamentable dull
grating sound, the ship struck, ploughing long
and deep into the bottom of sand. The breakers
swayed her languidly from side to side with a
dismal motion, while the despairing cry arose,
“Now we be gone indeed, the Lord ha’ mercy
on us! We shall never see our homes again!”</p>

<p>And the crazy lad took up the word, crying:</p>

<p>“We shall never see our homes again! Never!
never! never! Jack! poor Jack! Never! never!
never! never! What’s to become of poor Jack?
Home again! home from sea! Never! never!
never! never! Mother, I’ve brought ye a
parrot....”</p>

<p>But hereupon the boatswain, stepping to him,
laid hold on the poor antic, and, with a silken
band which he had, gagged him effectually. At
the same time my brother put a period to the
dejection and amazement, with blustering words
driving the men to labour.</p>

<p>He caused a great match to be contrived, that
we might learn how far we lay from the shore.
And, when they had set light to the tinder bound
about the end of a boarding-pike, and held it
forth over the sea, we descried the shore about a
cable’s length away.</p>

<p>Hereupon the Captain turns to the men, and
“Well, my lads,” says he, “Who’ll proffer for a
shore-party?”</p>

<p>But no man answered, save only Surgeon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
Burke, Thalass, and myself (we being even eager
to go); and, looking scornfully on the timorous
men, my brother said shortly:</p>

<p>“Out with the boat; I’ll go alone.”</p>

<p>Hereupon he went to his cabin to provide
himself for the adventure; and, having returned,
put himself immediately into the cock-boat,
which had been hoisted out and lay tumbling in
the languid breakers.</p>

<p>He began to row towards the shore.</p>

<p>We watched him pass over the black waters
in the lurid matchlight.</p>

<small>THE ISLAND OF THE HOLY.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">For</span> what time my brother should be gone,
Wallis, the master-gunner, was left in command;
and he presently ordered the lighted match to
be fastened in the waist, and three more matches
to be made, and disposed severally on the larboard,
at the head, and on the poop. Sentinels,
moreover, were posted all round the ship.</p>

<p>An hour passed. Silence was fallen upon the
ship; for some had gone below, and the rest
(saving the sentinels) lay sleeping and waking
between the guns. The waterfall sounded but
faint, and the breakers beat with a low clamour
that seemed muffled by the cloak of the
darkness. Suddenly, from a point close at hand
on the shore, came a sound of singing!</p>

<p>Sweet and tuneful was the note, and full and
lovely as the voice of a celestial being; an
exceeding melodious high treble, so that it
seemed to be no mortal that sang, but a spirit
from High Heaven. And thus it was:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">Stay not in the land of sighing,</div>
<div class="verse">Stay not in the vale of tears;</div>
<div class="verse">Where the phantom of the years</div>

<div class="verse">Lo! the Island of the Holy....</div>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>And suddenly it ceased. Clear on the silent
night was borne a cry—a loud, long-drawn,
quavering cry that told of terror and suffering
and the plucking forth of a life. Falling at that
season, and amid those dark and dreadful
mysteries, it was a thing to make the blood of
the boldest run cold.</p>

<p>Yet sorrow took hold on me at the sound;
for I knew the voice: it was the death-cry of
my brother.</p>

<p>The rest of the night passed uneventful. I
remained on deck, weeping and brooding.</p>

<p>I was sensible of having grown suddenly
older, of having from a lad changed into a
careworn man.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI.<br>

<small>SPIES OF CANAAN.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Day</span> dawned in crimson and gold; up rose the
sun, and showed us the Haunted Island.</p>

<p>There was a narrow shore of white sand,
curving and twisting with stupendous cliffs, the
sheer and beetling fronts of which could not have
had less than fifteen hundred feet. A little to
the left we spied an opening, wherein a river
ran spating down to the sea, making a great
indraught of the water, and occasioning, no
doubt, the current that had horsed us in.</p>

<p>It was now flood of tide; yet the depth of
water was increased but little, and, to our dismay,
the ship remained fast.</p>

<p>On seeing this, Wallis, the new Captain, caused
great store of heavy gear to be hove overboard
to lighten her. Yet ’twas all one: the ship
would not budge. Thereupon we got out the
boats and fastened tow-lines, to have rowed her
off; but we could not. Nay, it had been all
one even if we could have floated her; for soon
the land-breeze sunk, and then the wind came
from the sea.</p>

<p>So they gave over the attempt; and, their
anxiety being somewhat abated with the labour,
they turned in to breakfast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>I fared with Wallis in the great cabin, his
mate—one Peter Burrows—remaining with the
watch on deck. Wallis was very moody and
cross, and I dwelt heavily on the death of my
brother; so that the meal passed with but scant
speech. Wallis, afterwards going to the quarter-deck,
called lustily for all hands; and, when they
were come together, he made them a sort of
rambling speech.</p>

<p>“Shipmates,” said he, “there a’n’t no manner
of need for me to tell you how we lay. You
know what fell yester-night, that there be dark
things hatching yonder. We be fallen in on the
Devil’s island by the look on’t. Ay, but we
don’t properly know that yet! We a’n’t got the
bearings of this business; and maybe we’re like
children frighted with tricks and shows.</p>

<p>“Howsoever, this here a’n’t no sort o’ berth
for you and me, and I’d scamper away full-sail
if I could. But I can’t. We be stuck here as
fast as so many limpets; and when the wind
rises she’ll split, and we’ll be scurrying ashore
like rats!</p>

<p>“Well, then, I’m for leaving of her now, afore
the break-up comes—ay, and afore the night
comes, too! There be the boats; but this here
a’n’t the English Channel, and yonder a’n’t the
cliffs of Dover, and what we mought look for in
the boats a’n’t pleasant to think. No, there’s no
way out on’t that course, sure! So I gives my
vote for going ashore and boarding ’em while
there’s light.... And then the treasure!—you
a’n’t forgot the treasure, mates, as we’ve come so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
far for to get it? Well, then, who’ll offer for a
shore-party to spy ’em out?”</p>

<p>The words were brave and mettlesome
enough. But there was no weight in them.
All was hollow; and the seamen listening were
nothing slow to divine this. The speech fell
short of the mark, moving no man. Wallis,
indeed, was weighed in the balance and found
wanting there and then; for, when a seaman
asked, “And would you go along with us,
Wallis?” he halted out, “Nay, shipmate, for
I must mind the ship”—an answer which put a
period to that enterprise.</p>

<p>The seamen held off glum and murmuring, no
man offering. If, however, they had no stomach
for the work, Thalass and I were even eager to
set foot on the island; and, when Wallis and the
rest perceived this, they were nothing backward
to encourage us, giving us good words, proffering
us small-arms and ammunition, whilst some ran
to the cook-room to fetch victuals for us, and
others put themselves into the jolly-boat to row
us ashore.</p>

<p>Surgeon Burke would have gone with us, but
it seemed to him, and to us also, that his duty lay
rather in remaining on the ship.</p>

<p>Our first care on landing was to search the
parts of shore for the dead body of the Captain,
for we doubted not that he was dead; but found
nothing.</p>

<p>After that, we turned alongshore to the southward,
looking out for an opening into the island.
Thalass told me that he was able to guide me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
to the habitation of the pirates, but, however,
that it was far distant at the south side of the
island, and the journey and return not possibly
to be accomplished before night, to say nothing
of the risk we would run by attempting it. I
answered that therefore we should not attempt
it, but take instead a random course, making
what discoveries we could.</p>

<p>We advanced warily, having each of us a
loaded pistol in his hand; and, coming round
an elbow of the cliff beneath a gigantic headland,
we lost sight of the ship. The character of the
prospect remained unchanged, the bleached
white sands stretching away to the next bend,
the towering cliffs frowning upon us. The
Indian marched briskly at my side, perfectly at
his ease, as it should seem, and fearing no evil;
but I went harassed with a thousand apprehensions,
and was sometimes brought to a stand
by fantastical alarms.</p>

<p>The dreadful death-cry of my brother still
sounded in my ears, and even more than the
apparition on the shore, it put a fear on me. One
while glancing back fearfully over my shoulder,
another while looking aloft at those stupendous
summits, I went, indeed, like a haunted man.</p>

<p>At length, being gotten about a league along
the shore, we spied that we were looking out
for—an opening in the cliffs. For, a little in
advance of us, as we coasted round beneath a
headland, the cliffs were quite broken off about
two ships’ lengths, leaving an inlet of the island
indeed!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>A spacious and gentle valley it was, sloping
from the shore between the ends of the cliffs, which
were all hung about with vines, and adorned with
waving groves and rustling tall tufted grasses
and flowers crimson blue and green. We immediately
began to ascend, making towards a
colossal boulder of rock near forty feet in height.
Coming up to it, we climbed, by jagged ridges,
creepers and rockweed, to the top, and there
stood to view the country.</p>

<p>’Twas a charming panorama—champaign,
woody, and rocky in grateful alternation, or
confused and intermingled as in some silent
conflict; but of man, or man’s habitation, not a
trace! I asked Thalass whether this part of the
island was really uninhabited; he answered
after his broken manner:</p>

<p>“This side only him spirit, great, big;
look.” (Here he made a grimace that gave
me a scare, so like it was to that dreadful visage),
“and him little spirit, sing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Stay not in the land of sighing,</div>
<div class="verse">Stay not in the vale of tears....”</div>
</div></div>

<p>But hereupon I cut him short; for, indeed, he
sang so marvellously mimicking that other voice,
that I could not bear it.</p>

<p>We descended the great boulder; and, the hour
being about midday and the sun shining hot,
we looked out for a place to rest in, and found it
beneath the shade of a banana tree. The tree was
full of fruit, and we ate of it very deliciously, and
quenched our thirst at a clear spring that was near.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>We returned to our journey, or rather ramble,
of discovery, but lighted on nothing remarkable;
nor saw we any appearance of man. So, the
afternoon beginning to be far spent, and we a
great way from the shore, I thought it time to
be jogging from thence; for this finding no men
in the island had in no wise allayed, but rather
increased, my apprehensions, and the thought of
being overtaken by night there went very much
against my inclination.</p>

<p>Accordingly, we turned about, stepping out
briskly towards the shore; meanwhile the sky
became overcast with clouds. We came through
the ravine to the shore, and soon, to our great
content, in sight of the ship.</p>

<p>Drawing near, I hailed her. But there came
no answer, nor could we descry a man upon her
decks. I thought this looked very strangely: I
hallooed a second time; but again no answer.</p>

<p>And now a nameless fear began to take hold
on me; but, stepping to the marge of the shore,
I tried a third time, giving a great halloo. Yet
came there no answer: there was no sound nor
motion; there was not a sign of life on the
ship!</p>

<p>But twilight had fallen this while, and the
clouds looked black; and, even as my voice
yet echoed from the cliff, there fell a shadow
vast and vague, and dark shut down upon us like
a lid!</p>

<p>Then grew I afraid, indeed, drawing closer
to the Indian, who, too, I think, felt the terror
now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>“The place is enchanted,” said I, “we are
lost!”</p>

<p>But the cock-boat lay where the Captain had
left her upon the shore; and, getting her down,
we launched forth, intending to row out in a
bee-line and shoot for the ship. For, though
concealed by the darkness, we knew how she
lay.</p>

<p>We began to row, steering with the greatest
heed, until, by our reckoning, we had made way
enough, and should be up to the ship. Yet no
ship appeared.</p>

<p>We went a little farther; yet no sign of her.</p>

<p>Peering fearfully into the darkness, we ceased
to row. I took my pistol and fired it in the air,
listening for an answering hail or gunshot; but
none came.</p>

<p>’Tis a wonder I never thought to contrive a
flare with some tinder or other and my flint and
steel; but the truth is, my mind was completely
over-run and confused with innumerable fluttering
thoughts and whimsies and frightful apprehensions.
It came to me, indeed, that the ship
was no longer there, but had been spirited away
by enchantment. Nor, in view of the dreadful
mysteries of the place, will the reader be likely
to censure me.</p>

<p>Thalass thrust his hand into the sea. It was
immediately whelmed, the water gushing up
over his wrist: <i>the boat was being borne along
by a swift current!</i></p>

<p>The night was very dark, the sea moderately
calm. It was becoming cold, so that we were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
very glad of the liquor in our flasks; for, each
taking a dram, it warmed and spirited us.</p>

<p>Soon I observed the Indian to nod, for his
eyes were heavy; and I told him that he might
sleep, for I would watch. He sunk to slumber
immediately. But I was sore fatigued, and the
cock-boat rocked with a gentle motion: sleep
stole upon me like an enemy, making at the last,
as it were, a stealthy spring; in short, before
ever I could take thought to have waked the
Indian, I, too, slept.</p>

<p>Suddenly we were awakened.</p>

<p>There had come a great sound of cannonading
on the sea; the last of it was still in my waking
ears. It seemed to have come from close by.
The night drew on towards the dawn, and
was not so pitchy dark; I thought I made out
the loom of a large ship. Ay, it was a ship!</p>

<p>But not for long! Scarce, indeed, had she
hazily taken form before our eyes, but, with a
prodigious sound, she blew up.</p>

<p>Stunned by the concussion, I swooned in the
boat.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII.<br>

<small>DOCTOR COPICUS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">How</span> long I lay in the swoon I know not; but,
on my coming out of it, a strange, shrill voice
sounded in my ears.</p>

<p>I looked up, to behold a man who stood by
the side of a settee whereon I lay. He was a
very tall, lean, aged man, dressed in a scarlet
robe; and I knew him: ’twas he whom the
Englishman had called the Doctor. I was fallen
into the hands of the Master of the Haunted
Island!</p>

<p>The place was a little chamber, or cell, of stone.
There was another there, and him, also, I recognised
from the Englishman’s account; a
young man, slender and pale, habited in black—who
but the secretary, Ambrose?</p>

<p>The Doctor observed me. “So!” said he softly,
“The spirit hath returned to his ark of flesh.
He hath returned void.... No slightest olive-branch
of knowledge....”</p>

<p>He smiled on me; then, beckoning Ambrose
after him, he went stoopingly from the place,
the door shutting to upon them almost without
sound.</p>

<p>I looked about me. The cell was plainly but
handsomely furnished, the settee whereon I lay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
having coverings of China silk, wrought in many
colours with pictures of dragons. A little table
of cedar stood beside. The floor was covered
with a mat of grasses, woven in strands of red
and green. There was no lamp; the light, which
was bright as day, proceeding I knew not whence.
The cell was provided with air, it appeared, by
a row of round holes, the size of musket-bores,
pierced along the walls.</p>

<p>Soon Ambrose returned, bearing upon a salver
a dainty repast of fish, fowl, and fruit; and, having
set it down upon the little table, he asked me
pleasantly how I did.</p>

<p>“Very well, I thank you,” said I, “but you,
Ambrose, do scarce look as hearty as you ought,
dwelling, as you do, in the Promised Land!”</p>

<p>He stared at me, then laughed a shrill laugh.</p>

<p>“So you know of us,” said he, “who told you?
Ouvery?”</p>

<p>“No,” said I, “but another.”</p>

<p>“Another? and who was he? But tell me,
pray, how Ouvery died. He was a notable
villain.”</p>

<p>“He was so,” said I. “But who told you that
he was dead?”</p>

<p>“Why,” said he, “the Doctor had it from one
of your men.”</p>

<p>“They are, then, fallen into his hands?”
said I.</p>

<p>“They have joined us,” said he. “The
Doctor spoke with them whilst you and your
Indian were gone away into the island, and they
came over to us.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>“He must be a wondrous talker, then,” said I.
“He must have——”</p>

<p>“A golden tongue,” said he.</p>

<p>“But what of the Indian?” said I. “He is not
dead?”</p>

<p>“Nay, we found him with you in the boat.
Both of you lay swooning; but the Indian
revived apace, and is now with the rest of your
company.”</p>

<p>On that a phantom hope came upon my mind,
and I said:</p>

<p>“Is my brother.... Is the Captain alive
also?”</p>

<p>“I do not know,” said Ambrose; but I
thought he lied to me, and I said hotly:</p>

<p>“He was foully murdered in this evil——”</p>

<p>“Soft! soft!” said he, cutting me short, “if you
will take my counsel,” said he in a low voice,
“you’ll chasten your tongue. If the Doctor
had heard you, you’ld not have an hour to live!
And let me tell you, death is most dreadful
here!”</p>

<p>I shuddered; but tried to conceal it, asking
quickly:</p>

<p>“What manner of man is Doctor Copicus? Is
he a magician? Is the island enchanted? What
do you here?”</p>

<p>But he answered:</p>

<p>“I may not tell you these things. The Doctor
will do so in his own good time. And I stay
too long. Farewell. For the present, farewell.”</p>

<p>And, deaf to the importunities that I made, he
rose and went from the cell.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>I reckoned up what I had learnt. ’Twas but
little. One mystery, indeed, was resolved: that
of the deserted ship. But of the island and its
Master (save his name), I had learnt nothing. It
did appear, however, that the presence of the
man Ouvery amongst us at our first setting out,
was known to Doctor Copicus; whence, in all
probability, it followed he was by him sent to my
brother, to ensnare him and to occasion the
mutiny and our voyaging hither.</p>

<p>But to what end? What motives had persuaded
Doctor Copicus to cause the coming of a
renegade King’s ship? Perhaps, I thought, he
might want the ship, her ordnance, her men.</p>

<p>I next turned my thoughts upon the ghostly
figure that had frighted us. Was it supernatural?
Sure it must be! For what cunning,
short of sorcery, could possibly have contrived
that horrible and diabolical appearance? Nay,
had the thing been contrived by Doctor Copicus
to terrify us, how was it feasible that he wished
to frighten us away, after (by my surmise) having
enticed us to the island?</p>

<p>I was deep in these cogitations, when, on a
sudden, a shadow and a fear fell upon me; and,
looking round, I saw that Doctor Copicus again
stood within the cell. I met his gaze—but could
not support it, so searching was it.</p>

<p>“So, my lad,” said he, in mild and gentle tones,
“hast made a good recovery. A sound mind in
a sound body nature mends apace. Welcome,
Francis Clayton, welcome to the Promised
Land!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>“Sir,” replied I, “I thank you, but ask your
pardon if I know not what you mean by the
Promised Land.”</p>

<p>“Ha! and yet I supposed you not utterly
unversed in Holy Writ!”</p>

<p>But a sudden anger for the man came upon
me as I recalled my brother’s death, and I said
passionately:</p>

<p>“But what hath Holy Writ, forsooth, to do
with an island in the South Sea, and a horde of
cut-throat pirates?”</p>

<p>I was mad to have said it! A spasm crossed
the face of Doctor Copicus, and left it terrible.
His hands shook. He was silent, and the
silence was to me as the gathering of doom.</p>

<p>“Durst—durst insult me!” cried he at last,
hissing out the words, “Durst insult my disciples
and my work? Durst outbrave me, ye viper?
I’ll cure you! Ha!”</p>

<p>He took a step towards the door; but a
sudden faintness came over him. He staggered,
and had fallen; but I sprang forward and bore
him up, supporting him to the settee. He lay
there heavily and still.</p>

<p>The countenance of the Doctor looked very
old and haggard then, and white as the venerable
locks that fell straggling upon his lofty forehead.
His eyes were dim; his breathing came in gasps.
Verily I thought his hour was come. But, while
I stood wondering how the death of the man
would work on my fortunes, a change came over
him. He fetched a deep breath, and his brows
drew together. He made, as I could see, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
mighty effort of his will. He collected his
powers. He rose up from the settee, standing
firmly upon his feet!</p>

<p>It was masterful; it was magnificent. The
man, who, but a moment past, had been, as it
should seem, upon the threshold of death, did
now stand up with the vigour of an iron strength!
But his anger was passed, and he said even gently
as he turned to me:</p>

<p>“Lad, why do you vex me, courting death, and
worse than death? My intents towards you are
fair, and fairer than you could possibly imagine.
Hearken! I would give you riches, and fame,
and knowledge—the knowledge that lieth at the
door of life!”</p>

<p>But hereupon Ambrose returned; the Doctor
spoke to him briefly in the Latin tongue, and
betook himself from the cell.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII.<br>

<small>THE RUNNING MAN.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Ambrose</span> immediately after bade me rise and
make ready to follow him; for he had in charge,
he said, to take me to the <i>Cloisters</i>.</p>

<p>I was nothing loth. The curiosity I had to
learn more of the island, was now, indeed,
swollen to the highest pitch; so, within a brief
space, we went from the cell, coming into a
passage of stone.</p>

<p>This passage was in all points like to that
which the Englishman had given me an account
of. There was, however, this difference in our
experiences: that, whereas he had started in
darkness to come by degrees into the shining of
a dazzling white light, I, on the contrary, did
meet with that strange illumination at the outset,
finding it to decrease as we proceeded, until
’twas but a glimmer; and so on into thickest
darkness.</p>

<p>But soon, in the distance, appeared a faint
brightness, like to the dim reflection of a mirror.
We went a little farther. ’Twas the light of day.
A door stood wide at the end of the corridor.</p>

<p>So came I forth from that mysterious prison-house,
and stood again under the open heaven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>Before and on either side were thick woods,
behind was the cavernous entry—yet having
no appearance of masonry, for a tangle of
many-blossomed creepers covered all.</p>

<p>But Ambrose, looking to see that I followed,
stepped straightway to that which had all the
look of a pathless thicket. When, however, we
were gotten within, brushing aside bush and
brake, there opened before us a path of the
woods—yet so slender a path, that ’twas scarce
to be discerned. Following it the distance of
about a quarter of a mile, we came forth upon
the cliff.</p>

<p>A battery stood against the sea, a huge rampart
long and large, hewed out of the rock, and
pierced at intervals in embrasures to accommodate
the great brass guns—they were, indeed,
of prodigious size—that bore upon the waters,
fifty feet below. The guns were mounted upon
carriages of iron, so as they could be turned this
way or that, to bear at large upon the sea. About
thirty feet behind them, stood a long house, built
of massive blocks of stone, divided into store-rooms
for the powder. The roof of it was
thatched with wattle and felt, against the rains.
Beside it, on end, stood another house, wherein
were many pipes of muskets.</p>

<p>At the other end of the rampart, men wrought
to extend it. A crew of bandits they were,
dressed very slovenly and gay in silk and Indian
cotton-stuff of many bright colours. Amongst
them, I saw divers of our men, who wrought
along with the others; and, spying us, one or two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
hallooed to me with hearty good cheer. But
some looked ill at ease and very sullen.</p>

<p>We turned, making to the norward along the
cliffs, having thick woods on our landward.</p>

<p>I looked to the sea-board, but could spy no
ships. I asked Ambrose concerning the <i>Tiger</i>;
he told me men were at work upon her, getting
ashore her guns, munition, and such other things
as the Doctor needed.</p>

<p>I heard him to my small content. “But the
men will not brook this,” said I. “They’ll rise.”</p>

<p>“They must brook it,” said he. “As to
rising, the Doctor, be sure, has not failed to
provide himself for that.”</p>

<p>“What force hath he?” asked I.</p>

<p>“If you mean as to the number of his men,”
replied he, “not much, and yet abundance for your
matter. But his strength is not in numbers.”</p>

<p>“In what, then?” asked I.</p>

<p>“You’ll learn that by observation,” said he
shortly.</p>

<p>Hereupon, being come to a place where the
ground slanted steeply up, we turned and went
inland beneath the slope.</p>

<p>“Say, are you learned?” asked Ambrose.
“Can you read Latin?”</p>

<p>“Indifferent well,” said I. “But why? Hath
Doctor Copicus, peradventure, a charity-school
in his island?”</p>

<p>He laughed his singular laugh. “Charity-school,”
said he, “is good! Yea, we shall put
you to school! And do you see to it that you
be industrious. Behold the marks of the rod!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>And, suddenly baring his forearm, he stretched
it forth before me. <i>The flesh was scarred with
the marks of heated irons!</i></p>

<p>“Merciful Heaven!” cried I.</p>

<p>“Take warning, then!” said Ambrose, “take
warning!” and covered his arm again.</p>

<p>This put a fear upon me, and I went on in a
heavy muse. Suddenly I was aroused sufficiently!
There had come, on a sudden, a most
dreadful roaring sound, long drawn out, and
proceeding, as it should seem, from the abysms
of the earth: as if the earth had given tongue,
like a great, savage wild beast, and was ready to
open her jaws and swallow us in a moment!</p>

<p>Shaking as with an ague, I asked him what
it was.</p>

<p>“You are pale,” said he, “nor do I wonder, if
this is the first time you have heard it. ’Tis the
voice of the Mount of Dread.”</p>

<p>“A volcan!” cried I, with swift understanding,
“there is, then, a volcan in the island. But
where? I see no height of a great mountain.”</p>

<p>“The mightiness of the Mount of Dread,”
replied Ambrose, “appeareth not by height.
Greatest and mightiest things look mean and
ordinary—is’t not so?”</p>

<p>“With high spiritual things,” said I, “it may
often be so; but with common things——”</p>

<p>“Nay, nay,” said he, “you are in the wrong.
Consider gunpowder, that sooty grain—how
much of it, think you, should suffice to uproot
and shake to pieces the firm foundation on which
we stand?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>We were now come to woods in low land.
We entered in, following a secret path.</p>

<p>Fain would I tell you of the beauty of these
woods; but, unless you could behold them,
’twere impossible you would understand.</p>

<p>I passed through them entranced. The woods
on the shore of the Island of Hispaniola were
beautiful, but not as these were; the foliage
was not so shining green, nor so delicately rare.
How can I tell you of the immense, massy leaves
of the breadfruit trees? Of the great feathery
ferns? Of the climbing ferns, knit in a network
between the polished stems of the cocoa-palms,
or hanging in air on their long, tremulous, hair-like
trails?</p>

<p>Here and there, the undergrowth was decked
with blossoming shrubs, pale primrose and
gorgeous crimson. High overhead, close and
intertwined, hung the fronds of the palm trees,
gently stirred by the breeze, glinting and flashing
in the green sunlight, like a roof wrought in
jade.</p>

<p>As we passed, a bevy of blue and scarlet
birds started in the thicket amongst the tall
grasses, and flew scattering up through the
palm-fronds like winged blossoms, but with
scarce any cry. Indeed, as I learnt after, all the
birds in the island were dumb. But there came
continually a humming and chirruping of insects,
and sudden stirrings and rustlings, as little
creatures of the undergrowth took flight.</p>

<p>Our way was entangled with cross-shoots, and
the snake-like tendrils of creepers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>“The Doctor would like this ill,” said
Ambrose, as he lopped a branch off. “I shall
warn Barleycorn. ’Tis like to save his life.”</p>

<p>“Who is Barleycorn?” asked I.</p>

<p>“He who has’t in charge to keep the paths of
the woods,” said he.</p>

<p>Presently we reached the heart of the wood,
which was a tangle of great stalks and creepers in
marshy ground. Here plants did grow on the very
boughs of the trees having the strangest flowers
that ever I saw. For one was in shape like a
jug; another like a panakin; others were as
monstrous insect-creatures seen in dreams. The
trees looked starved and wan. The air was hot
and heavy, as in a close sick-chamber.</p>

<p>Soon the wood became clearer and lighter;
and, coming presently round a thicket, I spied
a glimmering portal of day.</p>

<p>As we emerged, there came a man running.
His clothes were ragged and slovenly. He came
on, running and panting, like a hunted creature.
His face shone with sweat that glistened upon
his beard in drops, like dew. His eyes were
bright, and roamed about.</p>

<p>Thus he came on directly towards me; and,
had I not stepped to one side, he would have
run me down. He went on without taking any
notice of us.</p>

<p>“He hath been terror-struck,” said Ambrose,
as I stood staring round on the man. “He was
a traitor. ’Twas his punishment.”</p>

<p>And he told me the man had tried to escape
by night to a merchant-ship that lay off the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
island, and that the ghost had appeared to him
while he swam in the sea.</p>

<p>The running man was now screened by a promontory
of the wood, but his voice sounded
intermittently in a sort of shrieking very horrible
to hear.</p>

<p>I felt a weight come over me, and a sort of
horror of the sunlight.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX.<br>

<small>THE CLOISTERS. THE DOCTOR AND THE
VOLCAN.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> went on in silence, through a tract of low
level land, void of trees, but clothed with a sort
of monstrous tall grasses; and, having gone about
a mile and a half, we came to further woods
which skirted the scarps of mountains.</p>

<p>These mountains, or rather high hills, rose
not above two hundred feet; but, on either
side, they ranged along almost to the cliff,
making, as it were, a spine to the island with
their pointed tops. Hard by the woods we had
left, run a little swift river, having on its banks
many shrubs with scarlet blossoms, the leaves
whereof made sunning places for red and blue
butterflies.</p>

<p>Thus, for about a mile, the river run to
the westward; to pour itself, through a ferny
grotto, into a little lake, a lake scarce larger
than one of our English duck-ponds. ’Twas
almost circular in shape; and, being perfectly
free from water-plants and clear as crystal, it
shone in the sun-glare like a mirror.</p>

<p>We went this way; and had nigh reached the
margin of the lake, when Ambrose, on a sudden,
stooped forward on his bended knee upon
the ground where a patch of withered moss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
appeared like a scab in the tall grasses. Bidding
me to stand clear, he reached forth and set his
finger upon what I took for a little pebble there.
Next moment a square slab opened in the
ground, in manner of a trapdoor. ’Twas an iron
hatch cunningly masked with moss.</p>

<p>“This,” said Ambrose, “is the entry to the
Cloisters.”</p>

<p>And, stepping to the cavity, he began to
descend into it. “Follow!” said he. “Have
no fear!”</p>

<p>When he was gotten down sufficiently, I set
my foot upon a ladder within the pit; but, when
I had descended a good way in the darkness, I
saw that the lid above me was slowly shutting
down. I cried aloud, supposing that we were
entombed; but Ambrose laughed, his shrill voice
sounding eerily from below. Next moment,
there shone a dazzling light. ’Twas the strange
white light which I had known in the stone
passage, and it revealed such another passage of
stone.</p>

<p>I leaped the remaining steps of the ladder, and
followed Ambrose; who, having gone a little way
along, opened a door and passed within. He
pressed a little knob on the wall, and immediately
the place was filled with the white light, but not
so bright withal as in the passage. I beheld
a great circular chamber of stone; and the
painted walls and roof, and the mat of
plaited grasses upon the floor, made a harmony
of green, very comfortable to the eyes. A
cushioned seat, or divan, of green silk ran all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
round the wall; and above it, here and there,
were shelves containing books bound in green
calf. In the midst, stood three tall tables for
standing and writing at.</p>

<p>Ambrose stepped to the divan; and, opening
a drawer beneath, he took out clean parchments.
From another drawer, he took parchments covered
with writing. The writing was in Latin, roughly
scrawled and scarce legible. He set them side
by side upon one of the tables, saying:</p>

<p>“This is your task. You must make fair
copies of these.”</p>

<p>“And what,” said I, “if I will not?”</p>

<p>He smiled grimly. “But you will,” said he,
“unless, peradventure, you would pass through
the door that——”</p>

<p>He broke off, staring with a sudden fear. “I
have forgot the sulphur!” said he hoarsely,
“Come!”</p>

<p>And he turned, and run from the place.</p>

<p>We came without. Twilight was fallen this
while, and the woods looked desolate. Quickly
the sky turned violet blue, and the stars rushed out.</p>

<p>“Whither go we?” said I, as Ambrose led
the way through a clump of breadfruit trees.</p>

<p>“To gather sulphur,” said he, “Heaven help
me! I had forgot. Haste! Let us haste!”</p>

<p>Many bats flew in the shadowy air; and there
came continually a hoarse croaking of frogs, and
weird, rat-like voices. Fireflies flitted among
the trees, like a slow-fallen snow of fire. On
old logs and tree-stumps, blue fire flickered in
flying traces.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>Ambrose went so fast that I had much ado
to keep up with him.</p>

<p>There was no moon, and the constellations of
the stars were abridged with sombre clouds;
but, when we had gone about a mile, the darkness
began to be tinged with a faint lurid
glow, the air was hot and smelt sulphurous,
the vegetation grew sparse and stunted, on a
dark hard ground cracked in fissures.</p>

<p>Suddenly the voice of the volcan boomed, like
a terrible tocsin in the night. It came from close
in front.</p>

<p>We went a little farther; but, on a sudden,
Ambrose clutched hold on my arm. “Hist!”
said he in my ear, and drew me behind a curtain
of withered trees. He pointed between the
branches; I looked, and what I saw was this:</p>

<p>In an open space, the earth being bare and
blasted and black, was a little round hill, dark
red in colour, but pink about the top; in height
about fifty feet, and shaped like an inverted
bowl. White and pearly vapour ascended from
it thinly, in circling wraiths. At the foot thereof
stood Doctor Copicus.</p>

<p>He stood motionless, his face towards the
volcan. He began to speak.</p>

<p>“I grow liker and liker to thee!” said he,
with passion in his shrill voice, “Liker to thy
hollow heart! thy hollow, fiery heart!... I, too,
am a volcan! On fire! On fire! Waiting!</p>

<p>“That I should be baffled, denied the secret
which holds me from my revenge!</p>

<p>“Yet it cannot be for long. A little while,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
but a little while, and I shall come at it, I shall
find my combustible! Then tremble, thou
accursed race! You cast me out! You cast
me out! Ha! Your proud cities, your bigot
universities, your palaces, the very cottages upon
your fields, shall be shattered! shall be
shattered! I’ll make them like to this place of
ashes!”</p>

<p>His voice rose, and quavered, and broke; the
strung, tortured note of it sounds even yet in
my ears. He shook his clenched fist above
him; and, as he turned in the weird light, I
saw that his brow was ribbed and stricken like
the twisted lava-stones that strewed his path.</p>

<p>He scarce had ended, but another figure—a
little lad—appeared from behind the volcan.
His face was wild and mazed; his long
brown hair fell straggling upon his forehead;
his body was thin like a skeleton. He was
dressed in the rags and tatters of a seaman’s
watch-cloak. I knew him: ’twas the little antic
lad whom the Englishman had told me of.</p>

<p>He came, stepping trippingly, to the Doctor’s
side, and said in a shrill voice:</p>

<p>“I heard the Toad shriek, and his golden
eggs are rifled!”</p>

<p>The Doctor turned; and, stamping his foot,
he asked:</p>

<p>“When was this?”</p>

<p>The lad answered:</p>

<p>“Like a swallow I fly. I saw and I flew.”</p>

<p>“Is he ’scaped?” said the Doctor. “Is he
tracked? Is the White One out?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>“He is out! He is out! and tracking about,”
cried the lad.</p>

<p>There was silence; while the antic lad turned,
and looked directly towards us. Then he began:</p>

<p>“Two is two, and four is four....”</p>

<p>“Away!” said Ambrose in my ear. “Soft!...
Now!”</p>

<p>We stole away on tip-toe in the shadow of
the blasted trees.</p>

<p>“To the right,” said Ambrose in a whisper;
and, as we came upon turfy ground, “Run, soft
and swift, for your life!” said he.</p>

<p>And we set off on silent foot, hearkening,
in fear and trembling.</p>

<small>THE PHANTOM VOICE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> night was become darker; we took the
darkest ways.</p>

<p>When we had run for about a quarter of an
hour, and were come, panting, to the side of a
wood, Ambrose stood and hearkened intently.
Then he cast himself upon the ground, setting
his hand to his heart.</p>

<p>“Do you suffer pain?” asked I.</p>

<p>“Ay,” said he, and groaned. “Do not speak
to me,” added he, with a woful pang. His face
was white and drawn, and he kept clutching at
the prickly boughs of a bramble bush, tearing
the flesh of his hand all bloody.</p>

<p>“What can I do?” said I. “Is there anything
I can do?”</p>

<p>“No, no,” said he. “It will pass.”</p>

<p>I sat down by his side, hearkening dismally to
the croaking of the frogs, watching the sombre
flying bats.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came a sound of singing. It
was that magical high treble voice which had
sung before my brother died. Thus it came,
small and faint, yet perfectly clear:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">He led his little pilgrim band</div>
<div class="indent">In thirst and hunger, frost and fire,</div>
<div class="verse">Unto a very pleasant land,</div>
<div class="indent">Unto a land of heart’s desire.</div>
</div></div>

<p>It affected me with a sort of awe; so that,
when it ceased, I was as one spell-bound, and
could not at first move or speak.</p>

<p>“What is it?” said I. “It came before my
brother died.”</p>

<p>“Ay,” said Ambrose in a quaking voice, “It
means death.”</p>

<p>“To whom? To you or me?”</p>

<p>“Nay, it is too far off,” said he.</p>

<p>“Is’t a spirit?” said I.</p>

<p>“Ay,” said he, getting to his feet. “Let us
be gone.”</p>

<p>“Whither?” asked I.</p>

<p>“To the Cells.”</p>

<p>As we set off, I asked him why he was so
much afraid at the volcan.</p>

<p>“The lad descried us,” said he—“did you not
see it? If he told the Doctor, we may say good
night!”</p>

<p>“Can’t we escape?” said I.</p>

<p>“Escape!” said he, “from this island?”</p>

<p>“Why should we not abscond into the woods,
near to the shore, and live on fruits and shell-fish,
until we could make us a boat?”</p>

<p>“And where would you voyage to in your
boat? The nearest land is a hundred miles
away.”</p>

<p>“We might be taken up,” said I.</p>

<p>“A chance in a thousand thousands, and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
by one of the Doctor’s ships belike! You speak
as a child.”</p>

<p>“Well then,” said I desperately, “why should
we not abscond into the woods until a ship
leaves, and smuggle us away on board of her,
and take our chance?”</p>

<p>“Of being tormented to death,” said Ambrose.</p>

<p>I could answer nothing to this; and I left that
discourse, to ask him:</p>

<p>“Is that lad crazy? The Doctor conversed
him as though he was rational.”</p>

<p>“The lad is a dæmon, or familiar, of the
Doctor,” answered Ambrose. “He is, as I may
say, super-rational. He hath strange powers.
He can see spirits.”</p>

<p>“What meant he by saying the Toad was
out?”</p>

<p>“It makes a sort of shrieking sound,” said he.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” said I. “Is’t a wild
beast?”</p>

<p>“I think it’s a wild beast of hell,” said he.
“I know nought of it. The island is full of
mysteries. Ask me no more questions. I am
sick at heart.”</p>

<p>We went a little farther, and then stopped;
for a lamentable and piercing cry was lifted in
the night.</p>

<p>“What is it?” cried I aghast. But Ambrose
answered not.</p>

<p>The cry had sounded from in front of us. We
began to advance again, but had not gone thirty
paces when we heard a sort of gasping sound
that came from the side of a thicket in our path.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
Hasting thither, we spied the form of a man
lying huddled upon the ground.</p>

<p>We bent over him, peering into his face.
’Twas ghastly white, and all twisted to one side
as with strong pain. His eyes were shut.
Presently they opened, glazed and staring, and
we perceived that he was dead.</p>

<p>I looked to see where he was stricken; but
found no hurt upon him.</p>

<p>“Let us be gone,” said Ambrose; and
immediately started off.</p>

<p>He went swiftly, but retired into the inward of
his mind, so that he returned me no answer
when at any time I spoke to him, nor gave any
sign that he heard me. So we came, at last,
through the second wood, to the entry of the
Cells, having met with no man, nor with any
further adventure. And, indeed, what we had
met withal was enough, for me!</p>

<p>Ambrose opened the great door, pressing a
knob beneath the hanging creepers, and we
passed in, going straightway to the cell which
was allotted to me. There Ambrose set his
finger to a little brass button upon the wall,
telling me that this would ring a bell in the
kitchen. However, he had to ring again before
a servant was summoned.</p>

<p>At last he came, rubbing his sleepy eyes. He
was a short, thick, swarthy man, dressed cleanly
in a shirt and breeches of Indian cotton-stuff.
He wore his black moustachios long and curled.</p>

<p>“Supper, Roc,” said Ambrose; and the man
made a bow to him, grinning so that his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
moustachios did stick up on his face like a ram’s
horns; and went swiftly from the cell, without
opening his mouth.</p>

<p>I asked Ambrose why the man spoke not; he
told me that he could not, being a mute. I
asked whether he was so born. He told me, no,
but that his tongue had been cut out for a
punishment.</p>

<small>THE MANUSCRIPTS.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I got</span> up betimes on the morrow, being
awakened by Ambrose; and, after breakfast, set
out with him for the Cloisters.</p>

<p>The Secretary was very gloomy, and brooded
in his mind. Nothing worth remark fell out on
the way, until we came to the second wood,
when, pointing to the right, Ambrose said:</p>

<p>“I ought to have told you: you see that region
of the wood? ’tis forbidden ground. The
Doctor will have none go there; and woe to the
man who disobeyeth him! I may tell you,” added
he, “that a deadly swamp is there.”</p>

<p>I was silent for a moment; then I asked him:</p>

<p>“Is nothing there besides the swamp?”</p>

<p>“I do not know,” said he, looking at me
strangely; and turned his head away.</p>

<p>We came to the trapdoor in the tall grasses;
and, having descended and entered into the
subterraneous hall, we set to work with the
manuscripts. The script I had to make a fair
copy of, was a treatise of philosophical ideas, being
disposed in many several essays. The matter
was profound, the style plain and perspicuous.
I took these extracts following:—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>(1) <i>The body is the shadow of the soul. It is
but the state, or medium, whereby immature souls
know and are known of one another.</i></p>

<p><i>They that judge after the appearance, do take
the creatures of the material universe for the
products and progeny thereof. Yet it, indeed, is
the product and progeny of them—if a mere
shadow (which only it is) may rightly be so called.
For the material universe, the sum and crasis of
bodies, is the shadow cast by the spiritual universe,
the sum and crasis of souls. It’s a picture cast
upon the curtain of the darkness, as when the sun,
shining through a coloured casement, throws a
picture upon a wall. And that which doth limn
out this picture of the material universe, is (as it
were) the coloured casement of minds and experiences;
the light whereof proceedeth from the Deity,
wherein all live and move and have their being.
Wherein, rather, all sleep, or sleeping, dream; or
dreaming, fitfully awake.</i></p>

<p><i>Yet this aggregate of minds and experiences,
that casts the shadow and maketh the picture, is
not the reasoning nor the sensible nor the carnal
part, but is that elemental region and those abysms
of being plumbing deep as the souls of plants and
stones and underlying in men and animals the
conscious part. As to the other regions—the
provinces of human reason and feeling and contemplation—these,
too, do picture forth; sometimes,
in gleams and glimpses, they portray images of
heaven; sometimes, darkly and distorting, they
conjure up visions of hell.</i></p>

<p>(2) <i>God is the only power, principle, and reality.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
All else is but emptiness and distortion and shadow.
If He should withdraw himself, the universe
would disappear, and leave not a rack behind.</i></p>

<p><i>The universe, in sooth, may be likened to a prism,
having many facets, revealing God. Love is the
light thereof, and is gathered by affinities betwixt
persons, and shineth in many coloured traits. He,
therefore, that loveth man with understanding,
also loveth God; and his love shall increase. But
he that loveth dotingly, and without understanding,
is an idolater; and his love is like to a candle set
up in a deep cavern: presently there shall be
darkness.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Ambrose wrought at a manuscript of poesy,
which he embellished in colour with strange and
beautiful pictures. As he wrought, he became
lost and out of himself; and, if I spoke to him,
he was angry.</p>

<p>I took a copy of this poem following:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

<div class="verse">Once I built a palace</div>
<div class="indent">Far from any land,</div>

<p>Ambrose told me ’twas written by the Doctor

left the Cloisters to return to the Cells.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII.<br>

<small>THE GLORIOUS PIRATE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> our way, as we entered the first wood, we
came upon the man Barleycorn, who trimmed
the path with a macheat. He was a small
hairy man, bowed with toil and parched in the
sun. He was a man of few words (as the saying
is). Ambrose passed him the time of day, and
he did but nod his head, as he lopped off a tree-shoot;
and, when I asked him pleasantly if his
work liked him, he merely winked at me with
his eye.</p>

<p>As we stood by him, another approached
through the wood. This was a great topping
pirate, dressed in sky-blue clothes, with scarlet
and green feathers in his hat. He did shine all
glorious in the sun with his silver buttons, rings,
pendants, bracelets, brooch, and buckle to his
belt. He came swearing, as the lapels of his
coat caught in the thicket; and, having drawn
near, he dealt Barleycorn a kick with his foot,
asking “Why the devil he kept not a better
gang-way?”</p>

<p>The poor man rolled under a bush, and lay
rubbing himself, with a rueful look on his wizened
countenance. Then he got up, and fell to work
again, saying meekly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>“Never be treading on old Barleycorn, mate.
The poor old fellow’s got his work to do.”</p>

<p>This made me laugh; and the pirate said:</p>

<p>“All’s well, old fellow. If this here was Port
Royal, I’d physic your bruise with the right
tipple. But there, it a’n’t!”</p>

<p>“No,” said Ambrose, “there’s no taverns here
for you.”</p>

<p>“I’ll speak nothing against the Doctor,” said
the pirate, “but ’tis a thirsty soil an’ thirsty toil,
and I wants my tipple. Water’s well enough
for wild Indians, but....” He broke off, fetching
a deep sigh.</p>

<p>“You mean to say—” began Ambrose; but
the other took him up short, saying fiercely:</p>

<p>“Belay with putting words in my mouth!
What I means to say, and what I don’t mean to
say, a’n’t none of your business. Belike you’ld
be bearing tales to the Doctor!”</p>

<p>“Nay,” said Ambrose; “you should know me
better than to say so.”</p>

<p>The other was as easily pacified as before he
had been incensed. “All’s well,” said he, “I’ll
treat you, too—in Port Royal.”</p>

<p>“How goes the work?” asked Ambrose.</p>

<p>“The ship work?” cried the pirate. “Trust me
not, if I a’n’t dog-sick of it! The blasting work
of haling the King’s ship ashore, above the tide
mark!”</p>

<p>“Have you careened her?” said Ambrose.</p>

<p>“Ay, ’tis done, praise the Saints!”</p>

<p>“What’s next to do?”</p>

<p>“Why, haven’t you heard? We’re to set to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
work with the carpenters to build another King’s
ship. John Rance hath his orders.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!” said Ambrose, much astonished.</p>

<p>“Ay, indeed! And pretty work we’re like to
have with it!”</p>

<p>“I marvel what the Doctor hath in mind,”
said Ambrose. “You do not know, do you?”</p>

<p>“No, by Saint Marta!” answered he, crossing
himself. “The Doctor’s intents and purposes
are above us seamen. We a’n’t for to think;
we’ve got our work to do, like old Barleycorn
there. Say, old fellow!” cried he, “bring to for
another kick!”</p>

<p>But the forester merely grumbled, as he plied
his macheat further along the path.</p>

<p>“But who’s this brave young gentleman?”
said the pirate, turning to me. “How do you
do, mister?” (holding his hand out), “My
name’s Jack Rodgers.”</p>

<p>I took the great hard hand, with a fit remark.</p>

<p>“You come in the King’s ship, didn’t you?”
asked he.</p>

<p>“Ay,” said I.</p>

<p>“I thought you did,” said he. “Well, I must
weigh. Fare you well, Mr. Clayton. Fare you
well, Mr. Ambrose.”</p>

<p>And with this, doffing his hat to us, and bowing
with a handsome congee, he went his way.
Presently we heard him swearing, as his coat
caught in the thicket.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII.<br>

<small>HEY-DIDDLE-DIDDLE!</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">We</span> came to the Cells; where Ambrose took
me into a cell just within the passage.</p>

<p>I was startled, and stood perfectly astonished
on the threshold; for the walls were all carved
out in figures of beautiful sculpture. The
subject was religious, depicting the martyrdoms
of Christian saints. But oh profanity! All
prominent among those august visages, was the
sculptured head of Doctor Copicus!</p>

<p>Ambrose observed my admiration well
pleased, and seemed to forget his gloom.</p>

<p>“You wrought these works?” asked I.</p>

<p>“Ay,” said he, “I wrought them. ’Tis my
talent, my delight ... I love beauty overmuch
... overmuch,” he added heavily. “It obscures
religion in me. I am taken with the shape and
outward form.... And yet that shape and
outward form is inherent in the Soul. And yet
I know, thanks to the Doctor, I know and
understand, that all is of the Soul.”</p>

<p>“What mean you by the <i>Soul</i>?” asked I.</p>

<p>“The Soul,” said he, “is the All-pervading,
All-constituting, All-loving power and substance,
in whom all souls do live and move and have
their being.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>“Thus spake the Doctor,” said I scoffing.</p>

<p>But Ambrose answered nothing.</p>

<p>“A seër, a prophet!” quoth I. “A just man
and a merciful! How many thousands of poor
mariners, pray, hath this righteous preacher
slain?”</p>

<p>Ambrose smote his forehead. “Have a care!”
said he, “What did I tell you? If the Doctor
heard you——”</p>

<p>“Oh, but you tempt me!” cried I, “You
tempt me! What! Would you have me to believe
that this pirate chief, this murderer——”</p>

<p>I broke off; for the door of the cell was
thrown violently open, and there entered, bursting
in upon us, the little lad whom we had seen
near the volcan.</p>

<p>“Tirralirra!” cried he in his shrill voice, and
stood stock and silent before us. I looked at
Ambrose, who stared on the lad.</p>

<p>“Well, Dominic?” said he in a quavering
voice.</p>

<p>The lad fell to capering about the cell. His
eyes glowed like lamps; and, on a sudden, he
cried:</p>

<p>“The mighty from their seats! The mighty
from their seats! Death is a pendulum! Death
is a swing! Up—down! See—saw! It pulls
down the mighty from their seats, and exalteth
the humble and meek! The clown is up and
the king down, hey-diddle-diddle for king and
clown!”</p>

<p>And, stepping to Ambrose, he put a slip of
paper in his hands.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>Ambrose looked on it.</p>

<p>“After twenty days,” said he quietly. “After
twenty days I die.”</p>

<p>I looked upon the parchment; thereon, in
fierce scrawled characters, was writ:</p>

<p class="center"><span class="large"><i>Post Viginti Dies.</i></span></p>

<p>“Why, what is this?” said I.</p>

<p>“The mandate of the Doctor. Because I
fetched not his sulphur,” said Ambrose.</p>

<p>“Tirralirra!” cried the lad, and, with a hop
and a skip, sped from the cell.</p>

<p>Ambrose sat silent, his haggard gaze bent
upon the floor; and I also was silent. At length
he spoke.</p>

<p>“Nay, but I am weary,” said he, “weary of it
all.... Over the rocks, over the flinty rocks,
have lain all the courses of my life....
Always uneasy!... Miserable!... Tormented!
tormented! But, when the Doctor revealed to
me the hidden truth, then came joy unto my
soul. No longer tormented with those dark and
hideous thoughts, no longer plunged in deep-down
gulfs of terror and despair.</p>

<p>“Let him, then, kill my body, since he hath
given life unto my soul! Ay, let him kill me,
for I am a-weary! A-weary!”</p>

<small>A CURSE FALLS UPON THE WOLVES.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">I parted</span> from him, to go to my cell. Later,
before dusk fell, I went out to take an evening
jaunt, betaking myself to the cliff.</p>

<p>At the fortifications I stood to watch divers
men who cleaned the great guns.</p>

<p>They were Frenchmen, and chattered over
their work, with much gesticulation. I spoke to
them; but they would not be troubled with me,
and returned me no answer. So I left them, to
go my way.</p>

<p>I rambled on along the cliff about half an
hour without observing anything remarkable;
and was going about to return, when, on a
sudden, I heard a sound of branches shaken
in a little thicket that skirted my path, and, to
my great joy, beheld Thalass, the Mosquito
Indian.</p>

<p>And, for his part, the faithful, affectionate
creature was so rejoiced to see me, that he knew
not how to express it sufficiently, casting himself
flat at my feet, or embracing me with a thousand
extravagant antics. Hereafter he wended beside
me along the cliff. But, on a sudden, he came
to a stand, looking fixedly to the sea-board.</p>

<p>He turned; and, plucking my arm, pointed to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
the horizon. I looked, straining my sight to
have made out what he descried; but I could
not. He told me it was the topsails of a ship.</p>

<p>This put me in a ferment to know what
manner of ship it was: a King’s ship, I hoped;
but doubted she would prove to be but a vessel
of the pirates returning home. However, the
wind coming briskly to the shore, and the ship
bearing directly in, soon I descried her. But
now the shades of night began to fall, so that
she was no longer visible to us. On this we
turned, and started back along the cliff.</p>

<p>As we drew near to the fortifications, there came
a sound of voices; and soon we beheld a gang
of pirates gathered about the guns. A small
man, having a scarlet feather stuck in his hat,
stood a little apart from the rest. He beckoned
to Thalass, who went to him. But I, bethinking
me of Ambrose, and of how the news of this
coming of a ship might avail to distract his
melancholy thoughts, determined to go to him.</p>

<p>Accordingly I took the path of the woods,
following it to the Cells. I found the knob
beneath the creepers, and tried to open the
door; but I could not. Thereupon I cast
about for a stone, to have knocked upon the
door with it. Whilst I did so, there came the
dull booming of cannonading out at sea. It
ceased; then, like a dread answer, the volcan
roared loud and long. Presently the cannonading
began again.</p>

<p>This made me mighty eager to learn what
these cannon-shots might mean. I was willing,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
also, to find out what was doing at the fortifications.
Accordingly I gave over trying to open
the door, and started back to the cliff; the
cannonading, meanwhile, being continued. The
heavens were splendid with the hosts of the
stars; the moon was not yet risen.</p>

<p>I reached the outward of the wood, and looked
keenly forth upon the fortifications. They were
full of men; and every gunner was plainly to be
distinguished by a point of yellow flame that
shone at the end of his linstock. But there
came no longer a sound of voices, and at that I
wondered; until I spied the form of Doctor
Copicus.</p>

<p>He stood at the nearer end of the battery,
looking out to the sea-board; and his tall,
bowed figure, dressed in the scarlet robe, upon
which his white locks fell glistening, had an
eldritch look in the starlight.</p>

<p>I stepped boldly forth, and took my station
by his side. He turned on my approach,
and I saw that his face was all alight with
excitement, like an eager child’s. But he said
nought to me.</p>

<p>I looked upon the starlit sea, and was amazed.
For, instead of one ship, as I had expected, there
were four; and three were in chase of the other.
The pursuers sailed almost abreast of one another,
were close upon their quarry, and kept firing at
her. The ships were about a mile and a half
from the shore. None had any flag abroad.
Thus they came on straight under the fortifications.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>Suddenly the Doctor turned, and spoke to me.</p>

<p>“See you my little lamb?” said he soft and
low, “See you my little lamb pursued by wolves?
Do you not weep? Doth not your heart burn
within you to behold this thing? But is there
none to help? Must I, then, stand by to see my
children devoured by ravenous beasts?”</p>

<p>And suddenly plucking hold on my shoulder,
he turned about, and strode on before the
fortifications, drawing me after him.</p>

<p>“Ho! Benedict,” cried he to the master-gunner,
“here’s a little lad come to see our
pretty things, our wondrous toys, our popguns!
Show him how they shoot, Benedict! Let him
see them hit a mark, Benedict!”</p>

<p>The small man grinned with his teeth, and
shouted an order; there fell a stir and business
and a <i>clang, clang, clang</i> of metal.</p>

<p>It ceased, and there was silence—for no sound
of cannonading came from the ships at sea.</p>

<p>The small man passed his gaze along the line;
then “<i>Fire!</i>” cried he.</p>

<p>There was a crash and a roar. To me it
seemed the very earth did split, and quake and
stagger. Stunned, I fell to the ground.</p>

<p>The Doctor himself raised me up, and, “See!
See!” cried he, pointing out beneath the lifting
cannon-smoke, “a curse is fallen upon the wolves!
They die! they die! They go down! down!
There shall not a one of them escape!”</p>

<p>The ship that had been pursued sailed slowly
in, and I could see the men crowding in the bows,
waving scarfs to us, and, doubtless, cheering.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
But of the other craft, there remained but a
confused wrack driving in the waves, swarmed
over with struggling seamen, as with rats.</p>

<p>I turned from the spectacle, sick at heart. I
knew not, and I know not to this day, what the
murdered men were—whether pirates or honest
merchantmen; but the fact of that disaster
smote upon me like a private calamity.</p>

<p>I returned to the Cells; and, contriving this
time to open the door, passed within and made
my way to Ambrose’s chamber.</p>

<p>The poor man sat as I had left him, sunk
into a dull dejection, so that he scarce took
any notice of my entering in. I told him what
had befallen; but he merely said:</p>

<p>“That’s the <i>Vandal</i>, I suppose, come home.”</p>

<p>“She had a stormy home-coming then,” said I.</p>

<p>“Ay,” said he.</p>

<p>“What were the other ships, I wonder,” said I.</p>

<p>But he returned me no answer.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV.<br>

<small>A GAUDY PICTURE IN A DARK FRAME.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> common sort of pirates had their dwelling
both in the Cells, and in a system of caves, in
part natural, in part excavated out of the cliff,
on the further shore of the island.</p>

<p>The Doctor had both a cell and a cave, sometimes
taking up his abode in one, sometimes in
the other. Adjacent to his cell, was his laboratory,
which was described sufficiently by the
Englishman in his narrative.</p>

<p>As concerning the Caves, I was never in them,
nor so much as set eyes on them in all my
sojourn on the island; being kept pretty busy
from day to day with Ambrose in the Cloisters.
On this account, also, I can tell you nothing
of the ship-building which went on at the other
side of the island. But, as that topping pirate
told us, they built the ship on the pattern of the
<i>Tiger</i>; wherein doth appear the main of the
Doctor’s intent in enticing us to the island. And
what we overheard him say at the volcan, as to
the hatred he had for some nation, and his search
for a combustible, may hint us he designed to
cruise upon that nation, and with that combustible
(when it was found), to destroy it.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
Further, as I surmise, that nation was none
other than England.</p>

<p>But leaving this in the midst, I continue my
relation.</p>

<p>Looking down from the cliff, then, on the
morning after the destruction of the four
ships, as I wended with Ambrose to the
Cloisters, I spied the pirate ship lying at an
anchor close in; and her longboat, heavy laden,
was being rowed to the shore, to a point where
some six or seven pirates stood ready to unlade
her. But of the shipwracks there was never a trace.</p>

<p>Returning at midday, we fell in on the cliff
with Surgeon Burke. He stood in converse with
the surgeon of the pirate ship, and introduced
me to him. I, in return, introduced Ambrose:
we might have been at a country ball, there was
such a ducking and bowing and doffing of hats!</p>

<p>When the last “Your servant, sir” had been
spoken, I asked the pirate surgeon whether his
voyage had prospered. He answered grimly
that they had gotten more blood than purchase;
whereupon Burke clapt him on the shoulder for
a “jolly leg and joint-carver for Jack Shark.”</p>

<p>“But come, Frank,” says Burke, turning to me
and crooking his arm in mine, “come you for a
jaunt with me. It’s long since we had sweet
converse, you and I; and Mr. Ambrose, I’ll
warrant, will not be hard hearted enough to
withhold ye!”</p>

<p>“Nay,” says Ambrose, “you may take your
jaunt for me.”</p>

<p>“Give me leave,” hereupon thrust in the pirate,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
and would have taken my other arm; but I
stepped on one side and put him off: whereupon
he laid hold on Burke instead.</p>

<p>Now, it was evident that Burke was willing to
converse me in private, and wanted none of the
other; yet he was so nice and genial by nature,
that to tell the man plainly so, he would not, but
must be still mincing the matter, throwing out
one glancing hint or another, which upon the
tough hide of the pirate proved but glancing
indeed.</p>

<p>But I, who could not away with such trifling,
put a period to it presently.</p>

<p>“Mr. Harper,” says I (for such was the pirate’s
name), “<i>Two are company, three are none.</i> ’Tis
an old saying.”</p>

<p>He stared at me; then he flared up.</p>

<p>“What mean you by that, you prating fool?”
cried he.</p>

<p>“I mean,” quoth I, “since you’re so dull, that
your room is better than your company.”</p>

<p>On that he drew his hanger and made a pass
on me; but I, too, could sail on that course: not
for nothing had I wrought at Clayton Manor, and
learnt to hold a foil under one of the cunningest
sworders of Italy. I stepped swiftly aside, and
drew my rapier; and, as sword and pirate came
blundering by me, I caught the one a tricksy
turn beneath the haft, so that it sped hurtling in
the air, and gave the other so shrewd a taste of
rapier-point as set him howling.</p>

<p>He recovered himself; and, firing off a volley
of threats and imprecations at me, turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
furiously, and cast about for his hanger. It was
fallen, however, into a cane-brake.... We left him
to fish it out as best he could, and parted from
him, not without laughter. I doubt not, he
wished he had his pistols.</p>

<p>“’Twas jolly sport,” cried I, giving him a
parting shot. “Another day we’ll to’t again!”</p>

<p>And Burke, who had got over his queasiness,
added:</p>

<p>“As good as quoits, i’ faith!” and bent double
with a laughter-fit.</p>

<p>Indeed, we were gotten quite out of sight of
the pirate ere Burke ceased to make merry over
him. Burke was ever inclined to hilarity; but
never, methought, so high as this. As we
swung along arm in arm, and taking no heed of
the way, he began to tell me many a merry tale
and many a jolly jest. But sure his jollity was
a malignant jollity, an elfin intoxication....</p>

<p>The island was most witchingly beautiful, the
woodland being a harmony of green and gold,
a chequer-work of mellow light and flashing
arcs; whilst golden shadows waved, and
jewelled motes danced in the shade of the
bowering trees.</p>

<p>Of all the merry japes that Burke told me
then, but one remains in my memory, like a
gaudy picture in a dark frame. It was the last
jest he was to make in this world.</p>

<p>“Did ever I tell you, Frank,” said he, “of old
John Baluster and the fun we had with him when
I was a boy? No? Well, this Baluster, you
must know, was a miserly flint of a man, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
withal as guzzling and greedy as a cardinal.
He contrived to stuff his paunch, and husband
his moneybags, by quartering himself upon his
acquaintances—friends he had none; and kept
flitting from one easy-going soul to another of
such as would suffer him.</p>

<p>“Of these was my father; a country doctor
he, but one more busied with his garden, his
plum trees, his dahlias, his roses, than with the
sick, of which (to speak sooth), he dealt with but a
few, and of that few (dear man), killed as many
as he cured.</p>

<p>“Well, on a day when Baluster was thus
battening upon us, having already stayed above
a month, my brother Dirk and I resolved, by
fair means or foul, to fire him out from thence.</p>

<p>“We stole into the parlour, where ’twas his
custom of an afternoon to snore off the surfeits
of his midday meal. There of a surety lay John,
a tunbelly of a man, a weary burden for my
mother’s dainty settee. His bald pate was
covered about with a crimson scarf (Lord! I
can see him now); his vast mouth sagged open
like a cod’s, the horrible sound that issued
therefrom frighted off the flies.</p>

<p>“For a space we stood, Dirk and I, looking on
him; then stole up; and, betwixt those cavernous
jaws, each, one after t’other, did empty a black
draught!</p>

<p>“We did this thing again on the next day;
and on the next we gave him the equal of three
black draughts!</p>

<p>“A change came over John Baluster. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
lost great part of his equanimity. He became
a trouble to my father: followed him about, a
consulting importunity. My father administered
unto him many various drugs; my father bled
him. Meanwhile, by some device or other
contrived by Dirk and me, he never wanted for
his black draughts. He had tendance enough!</p>

<p>“At last he took a notion that some one of the
servants was poisoning him, had his trunk packed
the self-same day, and departed.”</p>

<p>Burke ended with loud laughter, in which, I
joined; for he had a droll, dry manner of
telling a tale. Also I had contracted this while
much of his outrageous jollity. Hereafter, as
though spent with such laughter, we fell silent.</p>

<p>But, it seemed to me, that upon the woods,
also, a silence fell, and a shadow and a fear. I
looked up; but the sky was deep blue, and no
cloud obscured the sun.</p>

<p>Suddenly we came to a stop. There had come
a sound of singing in the woods, and the voice
that sang was that unearthly, magical high treble!</p>

<p>And thus it was:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">The whole heart is sick,</div>
<div class="verse">And the whole life is weary:</div>
<div class="verse">There rides an island in the central sea.</div>
<div class="verse">Lord of the island,</div>
<div class="verse">Lo! the Magician;</div>
<div class="verse">He knows the secret,</div>
<div class="verse">He hath the key.</div>
</div></div>

<p>“What is it?” cried Burke. “Where is it?”</p>

<p>Hereupon he set off running in the direction
whence the singing had appeared to come. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
followed; but I run lurching to this side and that
like a drunken man.</p>

<p>We came within a thick wood. Suddenly I,
who had taken no thought of the way hitherto,
espied close at hand a curious triad of palm trees
which I remembered to have seen before.</p>

<p>I thought swiftly as I went, asking myself
where I had seen those trees, and the answer was
borne in upon my mind with a gush of fear:
I remarked them in my second passing with
Ambrose through the second wood, and they
stood in that region of the wood which he had
warned me against venturing into!</p>

<p>I hallooed to Burke, who was gotten some
way in advance of me. “Come back!” cried I,
“Come back!”</p>

<p>But too late!</p>

<p>For, having found his way obstructed by a sort
of hedge, or clump, of mangrove roots, he had
leapt over it; and his voice came to me in a note
of fear.</p>

<p>“Help!” cried he, “I sink! Climb the hedge....
Nay, cut a stick and hold it forth to me. Haste!
Haste!”</p>

<p>I spied a strong sapling, whipped out my
knife, and cut it through. With this in my hand,
I mounted to a fork in the hedge, and looked
over.</p>

<p>There lay a tract of flat ground, all grown over
with shimmering green and yellow moss and
mottled with lichen and fungi, which stretched
away to tall reeds, and thence to woods.
A mist hung over it, and a cloud of buzzing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
insects. On the marge stood Burke sunk to his
thighs in ooze, and sinking still. His face, as he
turned it towards me, was drawn and grey, and
moist with the sweat of fear.</p>

<p>Staying myself upon the fork, I held the sapling
forth to him. He clutched it, and I pulled
away; but, though I used my utmost endeavours,
straining to the last bent, I could not hale him
out: the morass held him like a live thing.</p>

<p>Indeed, my efforts did but hasten his fate; for,
when, my strength being spent, I desisted, it began
to suck him in faster than before. At length I
yielded the attempt.</p>

<p>Thereupon Burke bethought him to cast himself
flat, that his body might offer the greater
obstruction to the swamp; but it was too late:
he was sunk too deep.</p>

<p>At last he ceased to struggle, and yielded
himself for lost; and, conquering his terror as
well as he could, be entrusted to me certain
charges in respect of his wife and child, to enact
if ever I should return to England. He died
bravely, committing his spirit unto God.</p>

<p>But this dreadful passage wrought a strange
effect in me. It filled me full of anger against
Doctor Copicus and all his works. As I gazed
upon the morass, which lay all shimmering and
steaming in the sun-glare, I swore that I would
bring the man to the bar of justice and judgment.</p>

<p>I stood there in the dank wood, in the dismal
shade of the mangrove trees, and I raged—I, a
weak, futile lad—against the man whose might
was like a strong tower. And suddenly, as though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
deriding me, the voice of the volcan roared in
thunder....</p>

<p>It came into my mind that the volcan was a
demoniac creature of the Doctor enforcing and
bodying forth his power; and, on the thought, I
shook my clenched fist towards the place where
it stood concealed.</p>

<p>But, ah, if I had but <i>known</i>!</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>It was becoming late; so I turned, and set off,
wending slowly and heavily, to the Cells.</p>

<p>As I came forth from the wood, I spied divers
of our men gathered together in talk, lying
sprawling upon the cliff; and, coasting over to
them, I sat down in the midst, and began to
question them upon their lot in the island, and
how it liked them. For I was willing to learn
whether there might be any possibility of banding
them together in a venture against the Doctor.</p>

<p>It appeared, however, that they were all well
content with the new state of things, and to consort
with the pirates.</p>

<p>Nay, they looked eagerly forward to go out
on the account (as the saying is), and to take
part in many a brave carouse at Caraccas or at
Port Royal.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVI.<br>

<small>THE TREASURE CHAMBER.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">There</span> passed some sixteen days, in which
happened nothing remarkable; nor learnt I in
that time anything more of the mysteries of the
island.</p>

<p>Ambrose could, or would, tell me nothing.
Indeed, he was become so taciturn and out of
humour, that scarce he spoke to me ever at all.
And then came the day when I hit upon the
secret path over the morass.</p>

<p>That there was such a path, and that it conducted
to something remarkable, I had from the
first received a persuasion. But though, in several
visits to the morass, I had sounded the marge of
it well-nigh all round (in compass about six
miles), I could never come at it.</p>

<p>And no wonder! For thus the thing was
revealed to me:</p>

<p>I had come to the place in the afternoon of
that day (of a morning I still wrought in the
Cloisters), and was working along in a maze of
mangrove trees, when close by me a young kid
leapt from the wood, and went bounding along
upon the morass as if upon perfectly firm ground.
I was surprised; but, when I thrust my stick
upon the slough at the point where I thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
the creature lighted, and the ground did yield
as soft as anywhere else, I stood like one
perfectly dumbfounded.</p>

<p>However, I essayed again, thrusting a little
farther forth, and this time found firm solid
ground. I tried to the right hand and to the left,
but in both places found swamp.</p>

<p>Here, at this very point, then, began the secret
path across the morass. But what a piece of
cunning it was! Or rather, perhaps, how wondrous
was nature’s cunning herein subservient
to man’s!</p>

<p>However, I stayed not to wonder; but, having
looked carefully round to make sure that none
was near, sprang boldly forth upon the path, and
began warily to tread it, feeling out before me
with my staff. It held good, and I came safe
to the other side where thick fern-trees grew in
the skirts of woods.</p>

<p>Setting up my staff to mark the place, I entered
the woods, coming soon to a delicious little green
hollow. The ground was glossy green moss;
in the midst it was all withered in a square
piece.</p>

<p>“O-ho!” said I, looking on it, “I know, I
think, what this means!” For I recalled the
withered patch of moss above the Cloisters. And,
stooping down, I felt about the roots of it.</p>

<p>It proved as I expected: the moss adhered to
the iron lid of a trapdoor.</p>

<p>I found the spring, and pressed it; and the
contrivance slowly opened. Now, during my
stay on the island, I had furnished myself with,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
and carried always about with me, the material
for contriving matches, namely: a good length of
dead cocoa-fibre steeped in oil and dried in the
sun. Accordingly, having cut a stick and broken
it in twain, I bound some of my fibre about the
ends of both pieces. I set one of my matches
upright in the pocket of my coat, lest I should
want it; and, having kindled the other with my
flint and steel, I held it down into the pit.</p>

<p>The match burnt brightly, which told me the
air was wholesome; so I set my foot upon the
ladder within, and, having the lighted match in
my hand, began to descend.</p>

<p>I reached the base; to find myself in a great
well, or cylindrical shaft, the walls of which
were clay hardened with fire. I looked for a
tunnel, or passage leading off from the place;
but in vain. I was in the act of mounting the
ladder, in despair of making any discovery,
when I spied a tiny knob of brass on the wall.
To this I set my finger, and pressed it. Immediately
a door flew open in the wall, revealing
the dark arched orifice of a passage.</p>

<p>I ventured within. My matchlight shone
flickering upon bare clay walls at first; but,
when I was gotten a little way, I near dropped
the torch, startled at what I suddenly beheld.</p>

<p>For, heaped up in a medley before me, was a
great vast treasure. Candlesticks and flagons
and jewelled sword-hilts, and plate and bars of
gold, half sunk in jewels without number and
without price: some of them being set in
beautiful ornaments, but the most part loose,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
and many uncut and unpolished as they had
been taken up out of the earth.</p>

<p>I stood at gaze, whilst diamonds, opals, and
emeralds gleamed and flashed in the matchlight,
like rainbowed lightning. Suddenly a dreadful
fear seized hold on me, and I dropped the match,
which flickered for a moment and went out: a
ghostly, clucking laughter had sounded through
the passage!</p>

<p>For a moment there was silence, while I stood
quaking; and then I knew who was with me in
that secret place.</p>

<p>“Are you, then, come as a robber?” came the
mocking voice of Doctor Copicus. “Would’st
despoil me of my wretched dole, the scanty
savings and substance of my old age? What!
shall the young tread down the aged, the strong
and lusty trample upon the infirm?”</p>

<p>“I have taken nothing,” said I in a quavering
voice.</p>

<p>“So. And are they worth taking, think you?”</p>

<p>I answered that it was an incalculable treasure.</p>

<p>“So. And what could it buy you?” said he,
“Love, wisdom, freedom, power?”</p>

<p>I replied that it could buy none of these.</p>

<p>“What then? I’ll tell you: <i>Shadows!</i> Houses
and lands—<i>shadow!</i> luxury—<i>shadow!</i> domination—<i>shadow!</i>
<i>Shadows! shadows! shadows!</i>
Vanity, trouble, and vexation of spirit! Set
your heart on shadow, and become shadow....
I tell you, my lad,” added he, with passion in
his voice and deep despair, “I tell you, that
if....”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>He ceased, and there was silence; a hollow
and throbbing silence, like the pulse of the
darkness.</p>

<p>Then the Doctor spoke again. “How came
you here?” said he.</p>

<p>I told him how I had found the path across the
morass.</p>

<p>“It remains,” said he, “for you to die....
And yet....”</p>

<p>He touched a knob upon the wall; and
immediately my sight was dazzled with the
bright white light, which flooded the passage.</p>

<p>“Come forth!” said the Doctor.</p>

<p>I obeyed, trembling, and stood with him in
the cylindrical chamber. I looked up; and the
great, white, rugged face came into my vision,
and filled it. But I could not endure his
piercing gaze, which searched into my soul.</p>

<p>“I am not willing to have you put to death,”
said he at last. “Nay, look on me! Lo, your
life is in my hands, and I spare it! You have
transgressed my weightiest command, and I
pardon you! Only swear to me, that you will
not divulge to any man the secret of the path, nor
throw out the slightest hint as to the treasure!”</p>

<p>“I pass my word on it,” said I, looking him in
the face.</p>

<p>“So. I will set my shining mark upon you.”</p>

<p>He took from an inner pocket of his robe
a tiny box wrought out of a single ouch of
emerald; and, having opened it, he dipped his
finger within, and strook it on me, from my chin
and jowl round to the back of my neck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>“Get you gone,” said he, “and return no
more!”</p>

<p>And he looked upon me terribly, and pointed
to the trapdoor.</p>

<p>I stepped to the ladder, and began to climb.
I was amazed; my thoughts run in a whirl.
The power of the man’s personality overshadowed
me. One thing alone I perceived: I had found
favour in his sight. But, with the thought, came
another. I would build upon that favour to
make intercession for Ambrose. I stayed my
ascent, and looked down. Doctor Copicus stood
observing me; and there was a strange, lamentable
look in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Sir,” said I, “I would speak with you....”</p>

<p>“Well?” asked he, as I stopped.</p>

<p>“Ambrose, your Secretary....” I began,
and stuck again.</p>

<p>“Well?” said he. “What of Ambrose?”</p>

<p>“Spare him——”</p>

<p>I broke off; for my heart died at the terrors
of his aspect, at the fearful anger that suddenly
blazed in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Begone!” cried he. And I threw myself up
the remaining steps of the ladder, and staggered
out into the wood.</p>

<small>FRANCIS FINDS HIS BROTHER’S WATCH.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Night</span> had fallen this while, and the hollow in
the thicket was black as pitch. I groped my
way forth, and, coming to the verge of the swamp,
searched for and found my stick that I had set
up there. Hereupon I stood and looked about
me, dazed and trembling.</p>

<p>The air was thick and fœtid with the mist
from the swamp. The heavens were overcast
with black clouds. Two shadowy night birds
flew continually in wavering and interlacing
curves. A sort of rat-like creatures scuttled in
and out the woods. A loud screeching cry,
having a strange vicious note in it, thrust in
every now and again upon the continual croaking
of frogs. It was borne in upon my mind, with
terror, that this was the voice of the Toad.</p>

<p>From the back of me came the murmuring
sound of the sea. Suddenly the moon appeared
betwixt ragged clouds, casting a livid light upon
the misty surface of the morass, and vanished.</p>

<p>In the daytime, in the warmth and light of the
sun, I cared little for the ghostly mysteries of
the island. I said that the Thing which had
frighted us on the ship—the dreadful ghostly
figure—had nothing spectral in it, but was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
contrived, after some wondrous manner, by
Doctor Copicus. But here, at night, in this weird
and desolate situation, my boldness proved to
be but a daylight boldness.</p>

<p>What, I asked myself, if the Thing should
arise before me here and now? What was that
screeching cry?</p>

<p>I took thought which way to go. It were a
drear thing to cross the morass in the dark.
What then?</p>

<p>I must, at all adventures, act, and act quickly,
or a panic terror would come upon me.</p>

<p>But whilst I stood thus in doubt, the
voice of the sea came to me: and, turning
that way, I thrust desperately in amongst the
woods. They were dark and dank like a cavern.
Unknown creatures started at my feet, uttering
weird cries. They were full of bats, which
fluttered about my head; and something winged
and heavy darted up from the undergrowth and
tore and bit at my face!</p>

<p>Perchance it was but a flying fox; but I
screamed with fright. I tore the thing from me,
and dashed myself headlong through the thick
covert. You may call me a craven; but, on
coming forth from that wood, I sobbed like a
terrified child!</p>

<p>I proceeded, wading and staggering through
tall reeds matted with creepers.</p>

<p>’Twas a desolate situation; and, as I went
staggering on through the reeds, I looked this
way and that, fearful of beholding the face of
some dreadful devil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>It seemed to me, that unearthly things did
peer at me upon every side. I fought against
the frenzy of my fear. Suddenly I caught the
sound of a rustling in the tall grasses at the
back of me. I drew my rapier, and stood,
looking back, hearkening intently; but could
hear it no more.</p>

<p>I strove to persuade myself that ’twas but an
alarum of my fluttering heart, and continued on
my way. But presently it came again, and
louder, doubtful no longer, but a sure token that
someone or something did follow me.</p>

<p>At last, being able no longer to endure the
suspense, I turned; and, casting away my stick,
with my drawn sword in my hand, I began to
move that way.</p>

<p>I had not gone a dozen paces, but I beheld
the form of an Indian, who crouched in the reeds.
He had a deadly blow-pipe in his hand. I was
ready to have fallen upon him with my rapier.
But, on a sudden (seeing, I suppose, the Doctor’s
mark upon me), he turned and betook himself
off, running swiftly; and so disappeared in the
darkness. In the same moment, I heard something
fall amongst the reeds.</p>

<p>Stepping to the place, I sought for it, and
found it. It was a gold watch, and on the back
thereof was graven the arms of my house; I
knew it to have been my brother’s!</p>

<p>Now, since it had been let slip by the Indian,
he it was, in all probability, who had murdered
my brother; the sense whereof stirred a lust of
vengeance in me, supplanting my late terror, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
I would have essayed to have followed that
Indian. However, I soon perceived I would
have been quite frustrate.</p>

<p>Accordingly, I turned and prosecuted my
way, reaching the cliff at last, and descending
to the shore, by way of a gully.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXVIII.<br>

<small>THE GHOST FACE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> tide was at ebb; but I walked down the
shore until I could see, faint and ashen, the
curled crests of the breakers and the foam
writhing upon the sand. I began to make
along to the northward.</p>

<p>There came a flash of lightning glimmering
upon the face of the high cliff. It was followed
a little after by another, a blinding flash; and
so continued intermittent. Presently a sort of
hoarse rolling sound came to me above the
clamour of the breakers. It waxed louder as I
proceeded, and soon I knew what it was: the
sound of waters falling from a blow-hole high
up on the lofty cliff.</p>

<p>But, as I drew nearer, for the fourth time that
night terror laid hold on me. For, as a flash of
lightning fell upon the waterfall, <i>from above it
there looked forth that frightful visage which had
struck terror to the heart of every man on board
the “Tiger”</i>!</p>

<p>I beheld the thing but for a moment; yet the
horror of it was more than I could bear. A
dizziness came over me, and I sank down in a
swound.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>It was early morning when I came to myself.
A tumultuous and thundrous sound was in my
ears. It was the clamour of the great waterfall,
joined with the roaring of the sea.</p>

<p>A wind was sprung up, a high and rocking
wind, that came in flurries, and swept round and
round and in and out the bends and indentations
of the cliff, to leap howling upon the giant
headland. The sea, risen high upon the shore,
gnashed and foamed in great breakers. But the
sky was cloudless blue, and the firmament clear
like crystal.</p>

<p>My face was wet with the flying scud; my
clothes had dried upon me. I felt fresh and
vigorous, as after deep sleep. I lay recalling
the grisly happenings of the night; and, on the
thought of the ghost face, a shadow and a chill
came over me—yea, even in the warmth and light
of the sun!</p>

<p>Yet, on a sudden, I took another kind of
thought. Getting to my feet, I looked directly
upon the cliff above the waterfall, and there
was the face—ay, even as I expected! For now
I knew what it really was: <i>a sculptured face,
vast and horrible, hewed out of the rock!</i></p>

<p>Yet even so, scarce I could bear to look upon
it. It was vast; it was prodigious; it was a
hellish thing! Never hideous gargoyle, never
infernal ghost, or chimera seen in dreams, looked
with an aspect so frightful and malign!</p>

<p>Who, I wondered, had conceived it, and whose
hand had wrought it? And immediately I
remembered those wondrous works of sculpture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
on the walls of Ambrose’s cell. Ambrose was
the man!</p>

<p>This, then, was what had scared us on board
the ship near out of our wits, and, no doubt, many
another ship’s company besides; a sculptured face,
the phantasm of a mind diseased, a nightmare
made stone! And, by the same token, I perceived,
what we had taken for flowing white
robes of the figure <i>was nothing else but flowing
water, the water falling from the blow-hole
beneath the visage from the high cliff</i>.</p>

<p>As to the illumination, that did not stumble
me. I had made it my play-game often, when
a child, to cast a light reflected on a mirror; so
an arc of the strange white light,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a> cast upon a
mirror, and reflected upon the face and falling
water, might well have served to create that
ghostly appearance.</p>

<p>But where was the mirror? There was a cave
near by; I stepped to it, and entered in. ’Twas
deep and dark; but I felt about the walls of it,
and sure enough found the mirror. It stood
set up against the rock, wrapped in a canvas
case.</p>

<p>Thus, then, the great mystery stood revealed.
A chance, albeit a wondrous chance, had unmasked
the trickery; for, if the lightning had
not fallen, as it did, directly upon the face, and in
that very moment of time, ’tis a thousand to one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
I had never seen it. For, on removing a little
to one side, I found that the face was no longer
to be descried. ’Twas the same when I essayed
the other way. The thing appeared only by
direct observation.</p>

<p>By means of this ghostly scarecrow, I apprehend,
Doctor Copicus had sought to preserve his
island inviolate of strangers, frighting away any
ships (save those he wanted), which happened to
wander near, scattering reports and rumours of
terror, building on the superstitions of the sea.
But why he should have employed the thing to
terrify us, whom, by means of Ouvery, he had
enticed hither, I could not at first understand.</p>

<p>However, casting back my thoughts upon past
events, I saw the fact: in suborning Ouvery to
the work, Doctor Copicus, no doubt, had given
him a sign to show forth on his returning in our
ship; which sign being wanting at our coming
to the island, he had been deceived as to what
we were.</p>

<small>THE FLOAT. THE WALKING LAD.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> hunger and thirst, which began to work in
me, diverted my thoughts.</p>

<p>My thirst I quenched with a draught from the
water of the cataract, though it tasted brackish.
Hereupon I began to walk back along the shore
towards the gully by which I had descended.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a>
But the sun began to shine scorching hot, and I
had not gone far, but I was fain to turn in to a
cave to shelter from the glare.</p>

<p>This cave was pretty deep, and the farther
parts were dark. Now, by this time of my
sojourn on the island, the instinct of curiosity
was become habitual with me; and I prepared
to search the cave, taking out my cocoa-fibre to
have set fire to it with my flint and steel. But
I found it would not kindle, being damp.</p>

<p>However, my sight becoming something
accustomed to the dim light, I began to
rummage amongst the pieces of fallen rock that
blocked the cave at the farther end. Here I
came upon the end of a ship’s cable which lay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
coiled in a hollow place behind a boulder.
’Twas fastened to a horse’s hide.</p>

<p>I was perplexed as to what the thing might
be, but presently knew it for a float (the horse’s
hide being blown up before use), and, by the
same token, its use and office in the business of
scaring poor mariners. For, recollecting the
episode of the cut cable in the night of our
coming to the island, I made small doubt that
one had been sent out on the float to do the
work.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[E]</a></p>

<p>From the cave I made my way towards the
gully, and so up to the higher land. Here were
woods, wherein I found a banana tree full of
fruit, and did eat of it very heartily. Hereupon
I turned along on the summit of the cliffs towards
the south, where the battery stood.</p>

<p>But within half a mile from thence I heard
the clamour of another cliff-waterfall; and,
having come to the place, and, looking over, I
beheld another great stone visage. Certainly
Doctor Copicus had slipped no opportunity to
fashion out his images of terror!</p>

<p>I laughed as I thought of it, laughed at myself
and at so many others thus befooled. We had
been as birds frighted with scarecrows! But, on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
a sudden, I became sensible that I was not
alone; and, looking up, I spied the skeleton lad,
Dominic, who had come out from a little thick
wood in front of me.</p>

<p>He came towards me, walking with a slow
and dreamy motion; and, as he drew near, I saw
that his eyes had a lifeless look, and, as it were,
a film upon them.</p>

<p>I took the occasion to converse him, being
curious to know many things concerning him.</p>

<p>“Well, Dominic,” said I pleasantly, “how do
you do this fine day?”</p>

<p>But he continued on his way, and did pass
me by without answering or taking any notice of
me; nor, indeed, did he seem so much as
sensible of my presence.</p>

<p>I stood, staring angrily round upon him,
thinking he affronted me.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you answer me?” cried I. “Are
you, then, deaf or dumb?”</p>

<p>But he went on as before. Hereupon I called
upon him to stand; and, when that also was of
none effect, I run and overtook him, and clutched
him by the sleeve of his ragged coat.</p>

<p>On this he started, sighed deeply, and looked
wildly round on me. This gave me a scare, so
that I let go of his sleeve, and took a step back
from him. I perceived I had awakened the lad
from a sort of trance.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon ...” I began.</p>

<p>“Tirralirra,” cried he, in his shrill voice, “he
begs pardon of Dominic! He ought to beg
pardon of the great magician.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>“What mean you?” asked I; but he stood
stock still, his head fallen upon his breast, and,
when I bent forward, peering into his eyes, I
saw that the lifeless and filmy look had returned
upon them, and that the lad was fallen back into
his strange trance.</p>

<p>Presently he stirred, and began to walk on
with the same slow and dreamy motion as
before.</p>

<p>I let him go his way, and went mine.</p>

<small>HOW NOW?</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">As</span> I awoke on the morrow, I felt a weight come
over me: ’twas the day on which, by order of
the Doctor, Ambrose was to die.</p>

<p>Nay, I could have wept to think that the poor
man was already dead.</p>

<p>I got up, and, not staying for breakfast,
hasted forth. I went to Ambrose’s cell; but
found it empty, and nobody in the passage. I
went out, and quickly traversed the wood.
Coming forth upon the cliff, I saw a strange
sight. The nearer slope of the rising ground
hard by the fortifications, and a great semicircle
of the ground below, was all covered with
pirates standing or seated on the grass.</p>

<p>I ran to them, and then I saw what this meant.
For, in the midst—that is, on the rise of the
hill—stood Ambrose; and two pirates had guard
over him, bearing muskets. Those looking on
made sport of the doomed man.</p>

<p>“He be going a long voyage, sure!” said
one, “and, as parsons say, ’tis blasting hot in
that port! Well then, boys, give him a rum
puncheon, can’t ye? for to take along with him!”</p>

<p>“Ay, ay,” said a second; “there be some jolly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
mates yonder will be right glad on’t—Firejaw,
an’ Bully Crackerbones, an’ Bullfrog, an’——”</p>

<p>“I’ll warrant, they a’n’t hotter than we!” put
in a third, “Why, this slope be blazing like a
grill! If the Doctor come not soon, I shall
weigh!”</p>

<p>“What! and part from old Blackcoat?”
returned the other, “Why, ha, ha,” (turning to
Ambrose), “shalt pass for a vicar in that garb!
Do but troll over a little Latin—I know you can—with
a <i>pax vobiscum</i> withal, and you’ll make
the other port!”</p>

<p>But Ambrose answered not a word, standing
with folded arms and stern gaze bent on the
ground.</p>

<p>“Hist!” cried one on a sudden, “the Doctor!”</p>

<p>On this, every man got immediately to his
feet, every voice was hushed. The guards ported
their muskets.</p>

<p>Doctor Copicus approached with slow steps,
leaning upon a staff of ivory and gold. His
scarlet robe and broad-brimmed hat shone
glorious in the sunlight. As he drew near, I
observed that every man looked this way and
that, but never on him. Abashed they stood,
those stalwart and swarthy pirates, like a crew of
chidden schoolboys!</p>

<p>As for Ambrose, he gave no sign.</p>

<p>The Doctor regarded them with fiery eyes;
and he cried fiercely:</p>

<p>“You madbrained, loggerheaded crew, what
do you here? May not one depart this life”
(pointing to Ambrose) “without being gazed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
by apes? What! shall I be poisoned with your
pestilent breath, ye cattle? Away! away! and
hide you! Into the woods and caves, and cover
you! Out of my sight!”</p>

<p>And, on a sudden, he fell upon them with his
ivory staff, with incredible fury.</p>

<p>Bruised and near blinded with the thick-coming
blows, those who stood within reach of
them fell confusedly back, thrusting upon those
behind, forcing them in upon Ambrose and the
guards.... The crowd swayed back and forth.</p>

<p>“Away! Away!” cried the Doctor in a
terrible voice; and, as one man, all fled.</p>

<p>Borne onward by the scurrying crew, I was
half-way up the hill before ever I could recover
to stand ground; whilst the last fugitives went
straggling by me. Yet three others, also, did
there separate themselves off from the rest. They
were Ambrose and the guards. The four of us
wended slowly down towards the Doctor.</p>

<p>“How now?” said he, when we were come to
him, “How now, Ambrose, my child? Are you
ready to depart, passing through the secret
door?”</p>

<p>“I am ready,” answered Ambrose.</p>

<p>“So. And fain would I follow you, if seeing
and hearing and understanding I might go!
Make ready!” (to the guards) “Up with your
muskets, and, when I give ye the word, when
I give ye the word,” repeated he, “shoot him
through the head!”</p>

<p>Thereupon they set light to their matches;
and, removing a little way from Ambrose, levelled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
their guns upon him. His face was white like
paper; but he held perfectly still and gave no
sign.</p>

<p>“Are you ready, Ambrose?” said the Doctor
presently, “I see that you are ready. Have you
nothing to ask of me? No boon?”</p>

<p>“Nay,” answered the other; “for hath an outworn
garment aught to ask of him who casts it
away?”</p>

<p>There was silence; and thereupon I, who
had stood by until then like one spell-bound,
recovered myself. I was ready to have drawn
my rapier, and madly to have fallen upon the
guards; but, chancing to look at Doctor Copicus,
I stopped: his face was all twisted like a child’s
that is about to burst forth into strong weeping.</p>

<p>It held but for a moment, and passed.</p>

<p>“Let the man go!” said Doctor Copicus.</p>

<p>But Ambrose sank swooning upon the grass.</p>

<small>NEITHER ONE NOR THE OTHER.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">That</span> night I dreamt a monstrous dream; and
it seemed to me that a ship anchored off the
island on a dark midnight.</p>

<p>Then rose up the dreadful figure on the shore,
and stretched forth an arm of stone, and with a
stone hand laid hold on the ship, and lifted her
aloft, and dropt her all shattered into the crater
of the volcan. Whereupon, with a blast of
sulphurous fire, the ship was blown an appalling
great height into the air.</p>

<p>With that, I awoke; but, though the phantasy
of my dream passed away, I knew, as by an
instinct, that something monstrous had, indeed,
happened on the island. I felt along the wall for
the little brass knob; and, having found and
pressed it, I looked round in the lighted cell.
<i>One of the walls was rent in a long fissure!</i></p>

<p>Scarce I had seen the thing, but the door
was thrown violently open, and Ambrose came
dashing in.</p>

<p>“Clayton!” cried he, terror in his staring eyes,
“Clayton!”</p>

<p>“An earthquake!” cried I, “Was’t an earthquake?”</p>

<p>“Ay,” answered he. “Haste! Come on! If
there come another, we shall be entombed!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>I put on a great cloak, and we hasted out. The
passage was full of men scantly dressed, making
towards the door. They cursed and swore, as
they shoved one another along helter-skelter.</p>

<p>Ambrose and I reached the great door, and
in a trice stood without in the darkness of the
night. ’Twas dark indeed! There was no moon
nor stars. The air was hot and heavy, and
seemed to throb in our ears.</p>

<p>Suddenly there came a jag of lightning that
rent the black heaven like a scroll; and the
thunder scarce had ceased to roll, but, flash upon
flash, and jag upon jag, the lightning came
continuously, as if it would seam and scar and
melt the firmament! The earth did crack and
crack as it came to ground.</p>

<p>There came a sudden, mighty flaw of wind;
and then fell the rain!</p>

<p>It fell in flows and cataracts, crashing upon
the trees of the wood like an avalanche, driving
the fugitives back into the passage.</p>

<p>Yet the outrageous tempest held not long,
ceasing as suddenly as it had begun. Hereupon
some were for returning to their beds; but all
trembled, wavering in their minds. Ambrose
and I made towards the wood, which was all
shattered and tumbled together, and the path
quite gone. With much ado, however, we
contrived to get through it, or rather over it; for
often we were obliged to climb.</p>

<p>“I am apt to think,” said I as we emerged
upon the cliff, “that ’twas no earthquake; the
lightning struck the place.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>“Nay, you are in the wrong,” replied Ambrose.
“The earth shook. ’Twas certainly an earthquake.”</p>

<p>“<i>It was neither one nor the other</i>,” came the
voice of Doctor Copicus, who stepped suddenly
into our path.</p>

<p>“I say that it was neither one nor the other,”
said he again; but there was no anger in his
voice—nay, he smiled on us, as he added:</p>

<p>“Hearken, my children! Come, walk with
me and hearken, for there’s somewhat I’d have
you to know.”</p>

<p>So, wondering greatly, we began to walk with
him alongst the cliff.</p>

<p>For a while, we went without speech. Then
the Doctor spoke again; but his voice was
strange and remote, as if he spoke to himself.</p>

<p>“Much injustice,” said he, “much contumely,
much wrong, I suffered at their hands. I, a
scholar such as cometh not in many generations,
a thinker compared with whom their subtlest
heads were as wooden blocks; I whose insight
was piercing to the soul! They despised me!
rejected me! cast me out!</p>

<p>“To destroy the nation, to destroy it root and
branch, to rase the populous cities, to blast the
countrysides; to find out a combustible, an
explosive searching as lightning, mighty that
blasting gunpowder would be, compared to it,
but a puny breath—such motives, such intents,
became henceforth the poles and axle of my
transported mind.</p>

<p>“This night, my children” (turning to us)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
“was that mighty thing discovered, and the
combustion of but a grain of it wrought the
convulsion that shook this island.... A cock-boat’s
burden would shake me a greater island!</p>

<p>“Thus the power is given—and the will is
taken away!</p>

<p>“How is my hatred broken? dissolved and
broken? like a bubble broken? My firm
purpose, tempered in the fires of hell, is no
more! no more! It went from me, Ambrose,
when I pardoned you on the hill!”</p>

<p>He fell silent; but we continued to pace along
in the sombre night.</p>

<p>“But hearken! mark me well! Ambrose, you
have the keeping of my parchments, what be
they?”</p>

<p>“The Book of Science, the Book of Poesy,
the Book of Life,” answered Ambrose.</p>

<p>“So. Therein is my wisdom stored; therein
is laid up the efficacy of my genius; therein is
traced and pencilled out my orbit and circling
arcs....”</p>

<p>He broke off; for there came a dreadful, subterraneous
rumbling sound. The ground did heave
beneath our feet. I was thrown staggering down.</p>

<p>The dread portent ceased. The earth fell
quiet. But, from a point in the interior of the
island, a blast of flame belched forth into the
night!<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[F]</a></p>

<small>HELL SHORE.</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">But</span> the dread geyser gave no light, and the
darkness about me was black. I could see
neither the Doctor nor Ambrose; and, when I
called to them, there came no answer.</p>

<p>Suddenly something leapt forth from the
thicket and seized hold on me. It was a man;
it was Thalass.</p>

<p>“Quickly! Quickly!” cried he. “I keep you
safe! I have boat!”</p>

<p>Hereupon he began to hurry me along faster
and faster.</p>

<p>The air became sulphurous and laden with
heated dust and ashes. A rumbling, low and
ominous, sounded intermittently from the region
of the volcan. The woods were full of the crying
of terrified beasts; and presently, from afar,
came the voices of men.</p>

<p>The darkness became tinged with a ruddy
glow. A fierce roaring sound arose. I looked
up, to see that all about the volcan, which continued
to belch forth fire, the woods were kindled
and roaring in a holocaust.</p>

<p>Scouring hard behind the Indian, I presently
descended with him a gully of the cliff, coming
safe to the shore. There he led me to a cave,
wherein lay housed a little, stout cockle-boat,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>
hewn all out of a great tree-trunk. In the stern
was a leathern sack full of bread, and a jar of
water. I helped him to hale her down the narrow
strip of shore. The breakers foamed and
gnashed like things possessed.</p>

<p>And now began the island to quake and to be
shaken to pieces: the cliffs split in flaws and
fissures, with stupendous sounds; the roar that
came to us from the woodland bespoke a deluge
of fire, over which, no doubt, the volcan reared
high its infernal plume.</p>

<p>“Quickly! Quickly!” cried Thalass, when the
boat was gotten down. “Get ’e in! Get ’e in!
Her good fine boat! No sink! no break! I
made ’e, fine! beautiful!”</p>

<p>“But you?” said I; “there’s no room.”</p>

<p>For I perceived that the little boat would
hold but one.</p>

<p>But there came a dreadful thundering of the
cliff, and fragments of rock fell about us like
hail. Lifting me bodily into the boat, Thalass
launched her forth, running out through the
breakers, and giving her at the last a mighty
impulse. I beheld for a moment his stern,
hard-favoured face shining like bronze in the
livid light—and saw it no more for ever!</p>

<p>Tossed in the turmoil of the boiling sea, the
boat blundered out beyond the breakers, vaulting
nimbly over the surges. I clutched her sides,
seared and scalded and near stifled with the
smoke and fiery spume and dust that blew
whirling down upon me from the erupting and
burning island. A giddiness came over me. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
fought against it hard, with shut eyes, bringing
the whole force of my will on the resolve to
endure and live.</p>

<p><i>There came the sound of singing.</i></p>

<p>The roar of the holocaust in the woods was
abated, the wind coming about from the sea; the
cliffs, for a space, had ceased to thunder; and, faint
and small, but clear and serene and bewitching
sweet, there sounded that phantom voice singing.</p>

<p>Struck out of myself with amazement, I forgot
all my peril as I listened.</p>

<p>And thus it was:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">Stay not in the land of sighing,</div>
<div class="verse">Stay not in the vale of tears;</div>
<div class="verse">Where the phantom of the years</div>
<div class="verse">Haunts the weary and the dying:</div>
<div class="verse">Lo! the Island of the Holy;</div>
<div class="verse">Hie you hither presently,</div>
<div class="verse">From a land of melancholy,</div>
<div class="verse">From a land of misery.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Straining my eyes upon the livid-looming
cliffs vaulted with fire, I made out a meagre form
standing upon the shore.</p>

<p>As the singing ceased, there came a sheet
of light, a tongue of flame, that, serpent-like,
wound coiling down; and then I saw the singer.
<i>’Twas the skeleton antic lad!</i></p>

<p>For a moment, the lull in the Inferno-storm
continued. Then, on a sudden, there came a
stupendous loud report; and, wave upon wave,
and sheet upon sheet, a sulphurous blue flame
swept, coiling and writhing, down the face of the
cliff, down upon the little lad!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>It leapt upon him; it lapt him round in
clinging, entwining wraiths; it encircled his
floating hair with tongues of flame. Thus, for a
moment, he stood transfigured; and then came
the end!</p>

<p>A giant boulder crashed from the summit of
the lofty cliff headlong down; and, rebounding
upon a spur of rock that projected almost to the
place where the lad stood, it took him upon the
head, and on the instant killed him.</p>

<p>But this was a merciful thing. For, hard upon
the falling boulder, there came an avalanche, an
avalanche of molten stone!</p>

<p>It roared down the cliff; it swept over the
shore. At its touch, the sea reared madly up in
an appalling great wave, hissing out clouds of
steam that veiled the livid light.</p>

<p>And upon me then there had fallen a dreadful
fate: to be whelmed in burning lava!</p>

<p>I saw it coming, the wave of torment and of
death. I gazed with a horrid fascination on its
livid front, livid and black and shimmering like
silver slime; and that instant was swollen
thousandfold with agony.</p>

<p>In the next, by a sudden strong rebuff of the
clashing seas, my boat was jerked slanting up,
and cast upon the beakhead of the pirate barque!</p>

<p>She had lasked away from her moorings; and,
unchecked by her drunken and amazed custodians,
had blundered round to save me.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">SUPPLEMENT.</h2>
</div>

<p><i>The manner of my preservation from the
Haunted Island, as well as other particulars, may
seem to many of my readers incredible; and
some, perhaps, will not stickle to brand the whole
relation as a fabulous tale.</i></p>

<p><i>I can only say, and I do aver it, that herein I
have set down nothing but what really fell out in
my experience, described nothing but what I
really saw in my brief sojourn on the island;
which is a misfortune one way, leaving some
things inevitably obscure.</i></p>

<p><i>As to what happened to me after my escape in
the pirate barque, ’tis beyond the drift of my
relation, since nothing further transpired concerning
the island itself. Indeed, as I believe,
’twas not only utterly devastated by that dreadful
eruption and conflagration, but sunk to the bottom
of the sea. And, as one returned from those parts
did tell me, there goes a rumour amongst seafaring
men of an enchanted island at the bottom of the
sea. Perchance it was set on foot by those pirates
who escaped with me; for, certainly, we alone
survived.</i></p>

<p><i>I owed my preservation from their hands at
first, mainly to the fact that they were always
fuddled with drink; like a drunken ship, she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
drove, in fair weather and foul, with only her
topsails abroad, our course (if a course it can be
called), being generally westward. At length, after
many days, and when both our drink and victuals
were nigh consumed, we drove blundering ashore
upon an unknown and uninhabited island.</i></p>

<p><i>This brought the pirates to their senses; and,
having no more drink to befuddle themselves with,
they began to amend, and took thought how to
preserve their lives. In this time also, they took a
notion into their superstitious heads, that ’twas for
my sake they had been miraculously preserved, so
that I was, as it were, the contrary to a Jonah unto
them.</i></p>

<p><i>The ship had grounded on a shoal, in calm
weather; and, not being stuck very fast, we contrived
to float her off. Having anchored her, we
went all on shore, to fill our jars and to lade
cocoanuts and plantains, and afterwards loosed to
sea again, committing ourselves to the conduct of
God. For there was not a navigator among us,
and we had quite lost our reckoning.</i></p>

<p><i>At length, we came to another island, where we
anchored again, filled our jars, and laded more
cocoanuts and plantains; and so on from island to
island: sometimes suffering dreadful privations in
the vaste desolate sea, when we despaired in our
minds of seeing land ever any more; sometimes
at imminent peril of our lives from savages and
cannibals—yet marvellously preserved, until, at
last, having wandered about for above two years,
by the mercy of God, we came to the Island of
Mindanao of the Philippine Islands; whence we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
stretched across to the coast of China, towards the
Isle of Macao.</i></p>

<p><i>Here was a Portuguese ship about to sail, and
I went on board of her. But the pirates remained
behind.</i></p>

<p><i>From Lisbon I got me a passage to Plymouth;
and so home to Clayton Manor, where, with my
father, the Squire, I dwell unto this day.</i></p>

<p class="ph1">SOME OPINIONS OF THE PRESS</p>

<p>“Treasure trove ... here is to be found the real gold of true, spontaneous,
natural English poetry; racial not only because its spirit is sea-born,
but because it is instinct in every line with the health and vigour of
those old English ballads both of land and sea that still give to our mother-tongue
pretty well all the original sap and sweetness that is left to it. More
than any of his previous verse this book of Mr. Masefield’s reminds one of
the old ballads.”—<i>Morning Advertiser.</i></p>

<p>“There is a touch on the heart in every one of these ballads; there is no
new touch, but, better far than that very rare gift, there is the true touch,
unpretentious, but quite unmistakable.”—<i>Vanity Fair.</i></p>

<p>“This invigorating book.... There is the strong joy of living in
Mr. Masefield’s poems—the open air and country, and peace. These ballads
are not mere songs of seafaring and adventure, and the hope in wild enterprise
which dawns for the imagined but never seen buccaneer. But Mr.
Masefield is something more. He seems not only to have experienced, but
even to have reflected.”—<i>Daily News.</i></p>

<p>“Mr. Masefield has achieved a unique position.... Other poets may be
more finished and perfect in form, but he possesses something far more valuable
than technique. He has his own way of looking at life and a style that
is in consequence quite natural and yet strikingly personal.”—<i>Outlook.</i></p>
